<h2><a name="PREFACE_BY_THE_GENERAL_EDITOR" id="PREFACE_BY_THE_GENERAL_EDITOR">PREFACE BY THE GENERAL EDITOR</a></h2>


<p>This series of books aims, first, to give the English
texts required for entrance to college in a form which
shall make them clear, interesting, and helpful to those
who are beginning the study of literature; and, second,
to supply the knowledge which the student needs to
pass the entrance examination. For these two reasons
it is called <em>The Gateway Series</em>.</p>

<p>The poems, plays, essays, and stories in these small
volumes are treated, first of all, as works of literature,
which were written to be read and enjoyed, not to be
parsed and scanned and pulled to pieces. A short life
of the author is given, and a portrait, in order to help
the student to know the real person who wrote the
book. The introduction tells what it is about, and
how it was written, and where the author got the idea,
and what it means. The notes at the foot of the page
are simply to give the sense of the hard words so that
the student can read straight on without turning to a
dictionary. The other notes, at the end of the book,
explain difficulties and allusions and fine points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The editors are chosen because of their thorough
training and special fitness to deal with the books
committed to them, and because they agree with this
idea of what a Gateway Series ought to be. They
express, in each case, their own views of the books
which they edit. Simplicity, thoroughness, shortness,
and clearness,&mdash;these, we hope, will be the marks of
the series.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The text of the <cite>Coverley</cite> papers in this volume is
that of G. Gregory Smith's edition of <cite>The Spectator</cite>.
This edition has been chosen because it reproduces the
original form of the papers after they had been corrected
by Steele and Addison for the first Collected
Edition of <cite>The Spectator</cite>, 1712-1715, and before they
had been tampered with by later editors. In three or
four instances, a few words have been omitted&mdash;the
omission in every case being indicated, and spelling,
punctuation, and capitalization have been modernized,
as they must be for a school text. In other particulars
it is believed the papers stand in this volume as they
were left by their authors.</p>

<p>All the <cite>Coverley</cite> papers are included except that one
by Tickell of which Addison himself disapproved. I
have thought it best, however, to print only entire
papers; and have not, therefore, culled the few paragraphs
in which incidental mention is made of Sir
Roger in the course of essays devoted chiefly to other
subjects.</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan of this Series, the occasional
brief notes needed to explain a word or to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
attention to some peculiar idiom or structure are set at
the foot of the page; longer, illustrative notes follow
the text at the end of the volume.</p>

<p>The best method of approach to the work of any
author is usually through a study of his life and surroundings;
this is certainly true of a literature so full
of personal interest as the literature of the age of Queen
Anne. I have, therefore, in the Introduction attempted
to give some notion of the personality of Steele and
Addison, and then some account of the social conditions
that explain the remarkable success of <cite>The Tatler</cite>
and <cite>The Spectator</cite>. Two or three books, like Thackeray's
<cite>English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century</cite> and Ashton's
<cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, will help the
student in his endeavour to frame in his imagination a
picture of the men and their time; but for comment on
<cite>The Spectator</cite>, nothing, after all, is worth so much as
<cite>The Spectator</cite> itself. The student should be encouraged
to read more of these charming papers, and to
make himself, if possible, a little at home in that most
urbane and hospitable period of English literature.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<h3><a id="I_Steele_and_Addison"></a>I. <span class="smcap">Steele and Addison</span></h3>

<p>On the morning of the 12th of April, 1709, there was
laid upon all the coffee-house tables of London the first
number of a double-column sheet in small folio, entitled
<cite>The Tatler, or the Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff</cite>.
<cite>The Tatler</cite> was to be issued thrice a week, on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays, and could be bought
for the moderate price of one penny. The pseudonym
Isaac Bickerstaff had been made familiar all over London,
some months before, by an admirable jest played
by Dr. Swift upon a notorious almanac maker and
quack astrologer, one Partridge. Swift, writing over
the signature of Bickerstaff, had gravely predicted that
Partridge would infallibly die at a certain day and hour,
and in another pamphlet had given a circumstantial
account of his decease; while poor Partridge convulsed
the town with frantic protestations that he was still
alive. But the editor of <cite>The Tatler</cite> who now assumed
this name of Bickerstaff was not Swift, but Richard
Steele. It seems to have been Steele's intention to
keep, for a time, his editorship a secret; but his disguise
was soon penetrated by at least one of his friends.
Joseph Addison, who was in Ireland when <cite>The Tatler</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
appeared, detected the hand of his friend in the sixth
number. He furnished Steele, it is said, with many
hints and suggestions for the early numbers of the
paper, and after his return from Ireland in 1710 became
himself a regular contributor. In January, 1711,
<cite>The Tatler</cite> came suddenly to an end, with the 271st
number. Steele, however, had no thought of abandoning
this form of literary effort, and on the first of the
following March he started that now more famous
journal, <cite>The Spectator</cite>. <cite>The Spectator</cite> was similar in
form and purpose to <cite>The Tatler</cite>, but it was to be issued
daily. It is usually spoken of as Addison's <cite>Spectator</cite>;
but it was no more Addison's than Steele's. The two
men were associated in the conduct of it from the start,
and their contributions were about equal in number&mdash;Addison
writing 274 papers, and Steele 236. The
second number of <cite>The Spectator</cite>, written by Steele,
contains the account of that club, of which Sir Roger
de Coverley was the most famous member; and the
Coverley papers followed at intervals through the
next year and a half.</p>

<p>The friendship of Steele and Addison was not
of recent growth. They had been boys together in
the Charterhouse School, London. Dick Steele at that
time was a fatherless,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and almost friendless, lad who
had been recommended to the Charterhouse by a distant
relative, the Duke of Ormond. Addison was the son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of the Dean of Lichfield, and came up to the Charterhouse
from a home of culture and learning. The two
young fellows formed here one of those school friendships
that last a lifetime. Addison, though a little the
younger, was doubtless a good deal the wiser of the
two; and there may have been in his regard a touch
of that patronizing temper which in later life he sometimes
showed in too superior a fashion. But for Steele
the acquaintance was certainly very fortunate. There
are pleasant glimpses of the young Irish lad invited for
a holiday to the home of his friend Addison, the quiet
deanery under the trees at Lichfield. Good Dean
Addison, Steele said many years after, loved him as
one of his own sons; and in that home the fatherless
boy saw how domestic love and purity lend a charm to
manners that all the wit and fashion of the town can
never give. In one of the most delightful of the
<cite>Tatler</cite> papers<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he gives a portrait of a father, dignified
and decorous yet affectionate, which is evidently drawn
from his recollections of the Lichfield household.</p>

<p>Addison was entered at Queen's College, Oxford, in
1687, at the early age of fifteen, and next year obtained
a scholarship at Magdalen, where he continued in residence,
as undergraduate, Master, and Fellow, until 1699.
Steele, whose scholarship was probably not brilliant,
though he had been in the Charterhouse two years
longer than Addison, did not follow him to Oxford
until 1690, when he was matriculated at Christ Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
He did not remain there, however, long enough to take
any degree. He never had the retiring and scholarly
tastes of his friend Addison, and after three years in
the university could resist the attractions of the great
outside world no longer. Looking about for a career,
he not unnaturally decided for the army; and in 1694
he left Oxford to enlist as a private in the Horse
Guards. He soon received a commission as ensign in
the regiment of Lord Cutts, and before 1700 is mentioned
as Captain Steele.</p>

<p>Steele's soldiering, which was nearly all done in
London and served chiefly to make him acquainted
with the town, might be passed over were it not for
one thing that came of it. His life in the Guards
was doubtless not so irregular as that of most soldiers;
but it was more irregular than his conscience
could approve. In the sincerity of his heart the
young Captain of the Guards bethought himself of
strengthening his moral and religious principles by
writing them down in black and white, judging, as he
said, that he might thereby be led to think about them
the more and by his desire of consistency make his life
conform to them the better. The result was the first&mdash;if
we except some verses printed at the death of Queen
Mary in 1695&mdash;of Steele's ventures in authorship, <cite>The
Christian Hero, An Argument to prove that No Principles
save those of Religion are sufficient to make a Great Man</cite>.
<cite>The Christian Hero</cite> is by no means a piece of priggery,
but a sensible and wise little book. It shows, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
on almost every page, some flavour of Steele's engaging
ingenuousness and humour. It is of historic interest,
too, as introducing a new style of writing. For it may
be called the first attempt to enlist the charm of wit and
good breeding in the service of religion; it contains
the germs of scores of essays Steele afterward wrote
with that intent.</p>

<p><cite>The Christian Hero</cite> did not correct all of Steele's
irregularities; but it did reveal to him where his best
ability lay. He said complacently, later in life, that
when he put on his jack-boots and mounted his horse
as a dragoon he wasn't acquainted with his own parts,
and didn't know that he could handle a pen better than
a sword; <cite>The Christian Hero</cite> taught him that. As soon
as the book was through the press he tried his hand at
a comedy, finding it necessary, as he said, to "enliven
his character." He might seem to have been careful,
however, not to overdo this enlivening of his character,
for his comedy was entitled <cite>The Funeral, or Grief Ã  la
Mode</cite>. But in spite of its lugubrious title, it contained
some genuinely humorous scenes, and by grace of very
good acting and the applause of Steele's fellow soldiers
of the Guards&mdash;who packed the house&mdash;it scored a
satisfactory stage success. Two other comedies followed
this in the next three years, <cite>The Lying Lover</cite> in
1703, and <cite>The Tender Husband</cite> in 1705. By this time
Steele's reputation as a wit was assured. Always what
Doctor Johnson used to call "a clubbable man," his easy
gayety and rather too convivial habits made him a typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
man about town; and Captain Steele began to be
spoken of as a man who talked charmingly, and who
could write as well as he talked.</p>

<p>In 1705 he married a widow, one Mrs. Stretch, who
died a year and a half later and left him a snug estate
in the Barbadoes. Thus secured against the chance of
adverse fortune, he sold his commission in the army,
and set up as man of letters. Like all the writers of
his time, however, he considered his pen to be at the
service of his political party, and expected a reward in
some civil office. In 1706 he was appointed Gentleman
Usher to Prince George of Denmark, the stupid
husband of Queen Anne, and in the following year was
given the more lucrative position of Gazetteer. This
office he held when, in 1709, he started <cite>The Tatler</cite>.</p>

<p>About a year after the death of his first wife, Steele
had married again, this time a "Welsh beauty," Miss
Mary Scurlock. The letters of Steele to this lady,
during the few weeks of acquaintance that preceded the
marriage and for years thereafter, are the most delightful
domestic correspondence in our language. They
are most of them mere notelets, written in his office, at
the club, in a tavern, anywhere whence he may send
her a kind word. Steele never had any mastery of
business, and it is probable that the bailiffs had something
to do with the frequent absences from home that
these letters record. Mrs. Steele, on the other hand,
was a woman of unusually thrifty and methodical habit,
to whom the carelessness and extravagance of her hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>band
must have been very trying. It is evident from
his letters that she sometimes gave him quite as much
advice as he felt himself able to use. After the first
few months, he has dropped the "Molly," and the letters
are uniformly addressed to his "Dear Prue"; and
once or twice he goes so far as to remonstrate with her
quietly for an unendurable interference with his "business."
Yet nothing disturbs his constant affection, and
the letters are filled with the same playful, tender prettinesses
to the last. That was a truthful signature with
which he once signed a midnight letter when he could
not come home: "I am, my dear Prue, a little in drink,
but at all times, Your Own Faithful Husband, Richard
Steele." There was no other man of letters in the
Queen Anne time, I am sure, whose domestic life
would bear turning wrong side out so well. Indeed,
no other writer of that age appreciated so well the
character of woman, or has given us such pictures of
the beauty and charm of home. It was Steele who paid
to Lady Elizabeth Hastings that best compliment ever
offered to a lady, "To love her is a liberal education."</p>

<p>It was in these happy, early years of his married
life, when his fortunes, though always precarious, were
hopeful, when he was enjoying the friendship of Halifax
and Addison and Swift, when his own humor and
invention were at their brightest, that Steele had the
one great inspiration of his life&mdash;he conceived the idea
of <cite>The Tatler</cite>.</p>

<p>Meantime, Addison had begun his career both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
politics and in letters. He had not been in haste&mdash;Mr.
Addison was never in haste. In 1698, some three
years after his friend Steele left Oxford, he had been
elected Fellow of Magdalen College, and seemed well
satisfied with the retired and scholarly life there. He
had some modest literary aspirations. In 1697 he published
some verses entitled <cite>An Account of the English
Poets</cite>, which make it evident that he had no relish for
Chaucer and Spenser, and which do not mention
Shakespeare at all. In Latin poetry his taste was happier.
He made a translation of the Georgics of Virgil,
prefaced by an essay that won compliments from the
great Dryden, and he wrote Latin verses of his own
that were thought to be of quite surprising excellence.
His classical studies may not have broadened his taste
or his intellect very much, but they doubtless did something
to cultivate that smoothness and nicety of phrase
for which he was afterward to be so noted. In those
years at Magdalen everybody supposed he would go
into the church. He seemed a parson born and bred.
And he doubtless would have taken orders, had it not
been for a piece of signal good fortune that befell him.
Dryden had introduced young Addison to Mr. Congreve,
and Mr. Congreve had introduced him to Montague,
afterward Lord Halifax. Montague it was worth
while to know. Really a great statesman and financier,
he had won some reputation as a poet in his earlier
days, and was always ambitious to be accounted the
friend and patron of letters. In those years the leaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of both political parties were coming to see the need of
enlisting the services of young men of wit and learning;
and Montague, whose appreciation perhaps was quickened
by some complimentary verses in excellent Latin,
deemed this Mr. Addison too promising an ally to lose.
Accordingly, in 1699, when he was twenty-seven, Addison
was given a handsome pension of three hundred
pounds a year, bidden go travel on the continent, keep
his eyes open, and learn French. He remained on the
continent about three years, when, at the death of King
William, his pension lapsed, and at the breaking out of
the great war of the Spanish Succession he was obliged
to return to England. His prospects for the next three
years were not bright. He had written some good
Latin verses, and some English verses that were not so
good. On his return from his travels he printed a
rather dull account of them, which few people read
then and which nobody reads now. He was known to
a little circle of great men, but he was dangerously near
poverty.</p>

<p>Yet good fortune never deserted Mr. Addison for
long. In 1704 the Duke of Marlborough won the
famous victory of Blenheim, and forthwith the little
Whig poets began to sing it. But much of their fustian
was so sublimely bad that even the Lord Treasurer,
Godolphin, to whom all poetry was very much alike,
began to see that the triumph was suffering for lack of
a worthy poet. In this emergency he applied to Montague,
whom he supposed to know most about such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
matters, and Montague recommended his old protÃ©gÃ©,
Addison. Thus it happened&mdash;if Pope's story be correct&mdash;that
one day there climbed to Mr. Addison's
lodgings, up three flights in the Haymarket, no less a
person than the Honorable Henry Boyle, Chancellor
of the Exchequer, with the request that Mr. Addison
write a poem. <cite>The Campaign</cite>, which Addison produced
in response to this august invitation, will be voted by
most readers to-day a dull poem; but it was much admired
then, and one simile in particular, comparing
Marlborough to an avenging angel, is said to have
captivated the imagination of Godolphin. At all events,
<cite>The Campaign</cite> served to introduce Addison to public
life. He was shortly after made Under-Secretary of
State, and was never out of office again so long as he
lived. In 1707 he was elected to Parliament; next
year was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Ireland&mdash;where
he was residing when Steele started <cite>The
Tatler</cite>,&mdash;and although he lost that office when the
Whigs went into a minority in 1710, yet he was one of
the few Whigs elected to Parliament that year; after
the death of Anne he went to Ireland again as Chief
Secretary, and for a little time before his death reached
his highest office as Secretary of State for England.
It was a career of easy and uninterrupted prosperity.
"I believe Mr. Addison could be elected king if he
chose," said Swift with a twinge of envy. Yet Addison
would never have been remembered for his public
services. His title to lasting fame, like that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Steele, rests upon the work done for <cite>The Tatler</cite> and
<cite>The Spectator</cite>.</p>

<p>The later writings of the two men are of less importance.
<cite>The Spectator</cite> was discontinued at the end
of 1712, and through the following year Steele conducted
a similar periodical, <cite>The Guardian</cite>, from which
political discussion was not to be so rigidly excluded as
it had been from <cite>The Spectator</cite>. In the next five years
he attempted three or four other papers, but they were
all short-lived, and of little interest. Addison revived
<cite>The Spectator</cite> in 1714, issuing it thrice a week for a
year, and in 1715-16 he conducted for some months a
periodical called <cite>The Freeholder</cite> in the interest of party
measures he was then advocating. But neither Steele
nor Addison ever had much success in managing an
enterprise of this sort alone.</p>

<p>In 1713 Addison produced his once famous play of
<cite>Cato</cite>. The reader of to-day will vote the <cite>Cato</cite> cold and
declamatory; but it was vastly admired then, as the
first correct and dignified tragedy upon the English
stage. The critics and the crowd united to praise,
and all the town went to see it. By this time Addison
was regarded as the foremost man of letters in England.
He set up a servant of his, one Buttons, as
proprietor of a coffee-house in Great Russell Street,
almost opposite "Will's," where Dryden had reigned
as critic twenty years before, and here he presided over
his circle of friends and admirers, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"Gave his little senate laws."</span></div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>Perhaps in his later years his happiest hours were
passed here. In 1716 he had married the Countess
Dowager of Warwick, to whom he had long paid patient
and dignified court; but if rumour is to be trusted, his
domestic life was not a happy one.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"Marrying discord in a noble wife"</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>was Pope's last thrust at him. He did not long survive
his fortune, good or ill, but died at Holland House, the
residence of his Countess, June 17, 1719, at the early
age of forty-seven.</p>

<p>Steele survived his friend more than ten years; but
they were years of inactivity. The great blow of his
life fell when his wife died in 1718. That year was
also further embittered by an unfortunate controversy
with Addison, which for the first time in their lives
estranged the two friends. After 1720 Steele retired
from London and passed his remaining years, partly in
Hereford and partly in the Welsh town of Carmarthen.
He had succeeded in paying all his debts; he kept the
love and esteem of all his old friends that were left;
and his temper was sweet and gentle to the last. He
died at Carmarthen, in September, 1729.</p>


<h3><a id="II_The_Tatler_and_The_Spectator"></a>II. <span class="smcap">The Tatler and The Spectator</span></h3>

<p>The date of the founding of <cite>The Tatler</cite> is important
as marking the beginning of popular literature in England.
From this humble origin sprang the great army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of magazines and reviews which, for the last two hundred
years, have contained so much of the best English
writing. Before <cite>The Tatler</cite>, it may be said that there
was no good reading in popular form. The English
novel was not yet born. The newspapers, about as
large as a lady's pocket handkerchief, contained nothing
but news, and very little of that. The political
pamphlet was purely partisan, was usually written by
penny-a-liners, and could rarely pretend to any permanent
interest or literary quality. In 1704 Daniel Defoe
had founded his <cite>Review</cite>, which deserves to be called
the earliest of political journals; but the <cite>Review</cite>, though
it contains much vigorous writing, was strictly a party
organ. Steele's purpose in <cite>The Tatler</cite> was quite different.
He is a humorist and moralist. He writes to entertain,
and incidentally, to correct or improve; he aims
to depict all the charms and the humours of society, and
to turn a playful satire upon its follies. To do this is
always to make literature; to do it as Steele and Addison
could, is to "show the very age and body of the
time his form and pressure."</p>

<p>The immediate success of <cite>The Tatler</cite> and <cite>The Spectator</cite>
is easily understood. In the first place, there was now
coming to be, for the first time, a large reading public
in England. Before 1700 no English author had made
a fortune or even a competence by the sale of his books.
But the most important social fact in England at the
beginning of the eighteenth century is the rapid growth
of a great middle class. Shrewd, energetic, these men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
were getting the trade and commerce of England mostly
into their hands, filling up the great towns, and exerting
an influence in public affairs which neither political
party could afford to overlook. It was for them that
the political pamphlet was written. How large a reading
public a popular pamphleteer might command at
this time, may be inferred from the fact that sixty
thousand copies of one of Defoe's pamphlets are said
to have been sold on the streets of London, and Swift's
famous tract, <cite>The Conduct of the Allies</cite>, ran through four
editions in a week. But these people demanded something
better than the party pamphlet. Intelligent, ambitious,
they had social aspirations, and were interested
in the life of the hour, in the club, in the drawing-room,
at the theatre. They had some relish, too, of
the best things in poetry and art. When Pope translated
the <cite>Iliad</cite> his publisher issued an elegant subscription
edition of six hundred and fifty copies for
more aristocratic purchasers; but he issued also a
cheap duodecimo edition for the general public, and
of this he seems to have sold about seven thousand
copies almost immediately after publication. Indeed,
if we except Addison, all the prominent men of letters
of the Queen Anne time&mdash;Steele, Swift, Pope, Prior,
Gay&mdash;themselves belonged to this middle class; they
were all the sons of tradesmen.</p>

<p>The readers for whom Steele and Addison wrote
nearly all lived in London&mdash;and loved it. They were
interested in the passing life of the town, in the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the stage, the coffee-house. Doubtless that old London
was an ugly, unkempt town. Its population was only
about half a million&mdash;less than one-tenth what it is to-day.
Its streets were narrow, ill-paved, and dirty,
separated from the strip of sidewalk on either hand by
reeking gutters. After nightfall, lighted only by flickering
oil lamps, they were the haunt of footpads who
terrorized the watchmen, and of bands of roistering
young blades who headed up women in barrels and
rolled them down hill for diversion, or chased the unwary
stranger into a corner and made him dance by
pricking him with their sword points. Public morals
were very low. Drunkenness and license confronted
the decent citizen on every hand, and, in public gardens
like Vauxhall, often held high carnival. Taste and
manners, even in what called itself polite society, were
often coarse. Profanity, loud and open, might have
been heard on the lips of fine ladies in places of public
resort; while Swift's <cite>Polite Conversation</cite> affords convincing
proof of how vapid and how gross the talk
might be at the ridotto or over the card table.</p>

<p>Yet if society at this time had its seamy side, it was
in the age of Anne that Englishmen began to feel the
charm of wit and manners, of fashion and breeding.
To the man about town, this murky London was the
centre of all that was best and brightest in a new
society. It was not so large but that he felt at home
in every part of it. In one coffee-house he met the wits
and men of letters, in another the scholars and clergy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in another the merchants, in another the men of fashion
and gallantry, and in all he could hear bright talk upon
the news of the day. In the theatre he could see the
latest play, written by Mr. Congreve or Mr. Addison,
and with a prologue by Mr. Pope. He probably belonged
to two or three clubs; and in the drawing-room
or at the assembly he enjoyed the society of women
with the charm of gentle manners and brilliant conversation.
All that served to make life attractive and character
urbane he found between Hyde Park and the
Bank.</p>

<p>Now it was to this quickened social sense that <cite>The
Tatler</cite> and <cite>The Spectator</cite> made appeal. They pictured
the life of the town from day to day, especially in its
lighter, more humorous phases. And this was always
done with some underlying moral purpose. As the
months go past, we have in these papers an exhaustless
flow of kindly satire upon the manners and minor
morals of society,&mdash;on behaviour at church, on ogling
the ladies, on snuff-taking, on the folly of enormous petticoats
and low tuckers, on the brainless fops that display
themselves in club windows and the brainless flirts
that display themselves in stage boxes. We have bits
of keen character-painting too&mdash;the small poet who
assures you that poets are born, not made; the beau
who is caught practising before the mirror to catch a
careless air; the man who is so ambitious to be thought
wise that he sets up for a free-thinker and talks atheism
all day at the club, though he says his prayers very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
carefully every night at home. One can imagine with
what pleasure the town must have seen its follies taken
off so smartly. Occasionally, too, there are short stories&mdash;usually
written by Steele&mdash;bits of domestic narrative
showing the peace and purity of home. In <cite>The
Spectator</cite>, the papers are somewhat longer and more
ambitious than those of <cite>The Tatler</cite>, and here are many
essays on graver themes, and carefully elaborated critical
studies, like the famous series by Addison on Milton's
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. Yet, from first to last, the most
interesting papers, both of <cite>The Tatler</cite> and <cite>The Spectator</cite>,
are those which depict with kindly irony the daily life
of the town. There is not to be found in English literature
up to that time any satire so wholesome, any
pictures of contemporary society so vivid and so entertaining.
Indeed, it may perhaps be said that, of the
sort, we have had nothing better in English literature
since.</p>

<p>For such writing as this it would be difficult to
imagine two men better fitted than Richard Steele and
Joseph Addison. Each supplied the deficiencies of the
other. Steele was an impulsive, warm-hearted man of
the world. Few men knew the society of that day in
all its phases better than he did, and certainly no man
liked it better. No English writer before him feels so
keenly the charm of the passing hour, or takes such
brisk and cheery interest in all the thousand events of
daily experience. His sympathies, too, were warm as
well as broad. His heart was tender, and he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
carried it on his sleeve. This amiable and ingenuous
temper made his writing very attractive, and still goes
far to atone for all its imperfections. Addison, on the
other hand, was a rather cool, self-contained, observant
man, who loved to sit in his club with a little circle of
admirers about him, and promote the good-nature of
the world in a somewhat superior and distant fashion.
His temper, less buoyant than Steele's, was more
thoughtful and reflective; his humour, more delicate and
subtle. And if his observation was not so broad as that
of Steele, it was nicer and more penetrating. Steele,
seeing life at more points, struck out more new incidents
and characters; Addison had more skill to
elaborate them.</p>

<p>In point of style the work of Addison is manifestly
superior to that of Steele. Steele's writing has, indeed,
the great merit of spontaneity. It is full of himself.
To read his easy, lively page is like hearing him talk
at your elbow; and, now and then, when his emotions
are warmed, he can snatch a grace beyond the reach of
art. But he was too impulsive and eager to stay for
that painstaking correction without which literary finish
is impossible. His rhetoric and even his grammar are
sometimes sadly to seek. The faults of his extempore
writing were matter of caustic comment by the critics
of his own day; and ever since it has been customary to
award the literary honours of <cite>The Tatler</cite> and <cite>The Spectator</cite>
not to Steele but to Addison. Nor is this unjust. For
Addison was the first of our writers to perceive clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
that simple and popular prose was capable of finished,
artistic treatment. That minute care, that trained skill
which hitherto had been reserved for poetry, he bestowed
upon his prose. He had naturally a nice taste,
an especially quick sense of movement and melody in
prose, and he took infinite pains. He would stop the
press to change a phrase, or set right a conjunction.
And this effort issued in a style in which all sense of
effort is lost in graceful ease. His thought is never
profound, and seldom vigorous; his range is not wide;
on serious subjects he is sometimes a little dull, and on
lighter subjects sometimes a little trivial; but his manner
is always suave, refined, urbane. He was the first
Englishman who succeeded in writing prose at once
familiar, idiomatic to the very verge of colloquialism,
and at the same time highly finished. You think such
writing is easily done until you try it yourself; then you
soon find your mistake.</p>


<h3><a id="III_The_Sir_Roger_de_Coverley_Papers"></a>III. <span class="smcap">The Sir Roger de Coverley Papers</span></h3>

<p>The Sir Roger de Coverley papers are often said to
be the precursor of the modern English novel. And in
a very real sense they are. There are, to be sure, crude
specimens of prose fiction in the preceding century that
may perhaps dispute this title, though most of them,
like the long-winded romances that found place in the
library of Sir Roger's lady friend, were of French origin
or pattern. But these romances, while they supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the element of plot and adventure most liberally, were
deficient in genuine characters. There are no real men
and women in them. Moreover, they made no attempt
to depict contemporary life as it was. But Sir Roger
de Coverley is no personage of romance. He is a
hearty, red-blooded, Tory gentleman who lives in
Worcestershire. And he has no adventures more
striking than might naturally befall a country squire
who comes up to London for the season once a year.
There were scores of just such men in every shire in
England. His speech, his habits, his prejudices, are
all shown us with simple truth. And yet this is done
with so much art and humour that Sir Roger is one
of the most living persons in our literature. He is as
immortal as Hamlet or Julius CÃ¦sar. We know him
as well as we know our nearest neighbour; and we like
him quite as well as we like most of our neighbours.</p>

<p>Now this was something new in English literature.
Sir Roger is the earliest person in English imaginative
prose that is really still alive. There are men and
women in our poetry before his day&mdash;in the drama
there is, of course, a great host of them; but in prose
literature Sir Roger is the first. Furthermore, the men
and women of the drama, even in that comedy of manners
which professed to reflect most accurately contemporary
society, were almost always drawn with some
romantic or satiric exaggeration; but there is no exaggeration
in the character of Sir Roger. Here was the
beginning of a healthy realism. It was only necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
for Richardson and Fielding, thirty years later, to bring
together several such genuine characters into a group,
and to show how the incidents of their lives naturally
ran into plot or story&mdash;and we have a novel.</p>

<p>The original suggestion for the character of Sir Roger
seems to have come from Steele, who wrote that account
of the Spectator Club (<cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 2) in which the
knight first appears. But it is to Addison's keener perception
and nicer art that we owe most of those subtle
and humorous touches of characterization which make
the portrait so real and so human. There is more of
movement and incident in Steele's papers, and there is
more of sentiment. It is Steele, for example, who tells
the story of the Journey to London, and recounts the
adventures of the Coverley ancestry; it is Steele, too,
who has most to say of the widow. But in the best
papers by Addison, like the Visit to the Abbey or the
Evening at the Theater, there is hardly a line that does
not reveal, in speech, or manner, or notion, some peculiarity
of the kindly gentleman we know and love so
well. If Steele outlined the portrait, it was left for
Addison to elaborate it. Moreover, a careful reading
of the papers will show that Steele's conception of the
character was slightly different from Addison's. Steele's
Sir Roger is whimsical and sentimental, but a man of
good sense; not only beloved but respected. Addison
dwells rather upon the old knight's rusticity, his old-fashioned,
patriarchal notions of society, his ignorance of
the town, his obsolete but kindly prejudices. The truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
is that in Addison's portrait there is always a trace of
covert satire upon the narrow conservatism of the Tory
country gentleman of his day. Addison's Sir Roger is
amiable and humorous; but he does not represent the
party of intelligence and progress&mdash;he is not a Whig.</p>

<p>Yet there are no real inconsistencies in the character
of Sir Roger. His whimsical humor, his sentiment, his
credulity, his benevolence, his amiable though obstinate
temper, are all combined in a personality so convincing
that we must always think of him as an actual
contemporary of the men who created him. He is the
typical conservative English country gentleman of the
Queen Anne time, not taking kindly to new ideas, but
sturdy, honest, order-loving, of large heart and simple
manners. To such men as he England owes the permanence
of much that is best in her institutions and her
national life. As one walks through Westminster Abbey
to-day, listening to the same chattering verger that
conducted Sir Roger&mdash;he has been going his rounds
ever since&mdash;one almost expects to see again the knight
sitting down in the coronation chair, or leaning on
Edward Third's sword while he tells the discomfited
guide the whole story of the Black Prince out of Baker's
Chronicle. If, indeed, we try in any way to bring back
to imagination the life of that bygone age, Sir Roger is
sure to come to mind at once, at the assizes, at Vauxhall,
or, best of all, at home in the country. He is part
of that life; as real to our thought as Swift or Marlborough,
or as Steele or Addison themselves.</p>

<h3><a id="BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p>No attempt is here made to give an exhaustive bibliography.
The following paragraphs contain only such a selection from
the literature of the subject as may be most accessible and of
most service both to the student and the teacher.</p>


<p class="center">TEXTS</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Steele and <cite>The Tatler</cite></span></p>

<p>There is no complete and uniform edition of the writings
of Steele. The best edition of <cite>The Tatler</cite> is that of Chalmers,
4 volumes, 1822 (reissued 1855-1856). A new edition,
however, in 4 volumes, edited by George A. Aitken, is now
in preparation. Two well-chosen and well-edited volumes of
selections from Steele's work are, <cite>Selections from Steele</cite>, edited
by G. R. Carpenter (<cite>AthenÃ¦um Press Series</cite>, 1897), and <cite>Selections
from Steele's Contributions to the Tatler, Spectator, and
Guardian</cite>, edited by Austin Dobson, 1897. Steele's <cite>Plays</cite>,
edited by George A. Aitken (1896), make one volume of <cite>The
Mermaid Series</cite>. For the letters of Steele, see <cite>The Epistolary
Correspondence of Richard Steele</cite>, edited by John Nichols,
2 volumes, 1789 (reissued 1809).</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Addison and <cite>The Spectator</cite></span></p>

<p>The best editions of <cite>The Spectator</cite> are: Henry Morley's,
3 volumes, 1883, or 1 volume, 1888; G. Gregory Smith's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
with Introductory Essay by Austin Dobson, 8 volumes,
1897-1898; and George A. Aitken's, 8 volumes, 1898. The
<cite>Complete Works</cite> of Addison were edited by G. W. Greene,
in 1854; a new issue of this edition appeared in 1891. The
best volume of selections from Addison is that edited by John
Richard Green, <cite>Essays of Joseph Addison</cite>, 1882.</p>


<p class="center">BIOGRAPHY</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Steele</span></p>

<p><cite>The Life of Richard Steele</cite>, by George A. Aitken, 1899.
This is the latest and fullest life.</p>

<p><cite>Richard Steele</cite>, by Austin Dobson, in the <cite>English Worthies
Series</cite>, 1886; a brief but appreciative study.</p>

<p><cite>Biographical Essays</cite>, by John Forster, 1860, <cite>Steele</cite>. This
paper, originally published in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> for March,
1855, gave, for the first time, that more favourable estimate of
the character and genius of Steele which is now generally
accepted.</p>

<p><cite>Lectures on the English Humorists, Steele</cite>, by W. M. Thackeray.
Thackeray's lecture, delivered first in 1851, is a most
charming and suggestive paper, but hardly just to Steele.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Addison</span></p>

<p><cite>Addison</cite>, by W. J. Courthope, in the <cite>English Men of Letters
Series</cite>, 1884. The best life; it has superseded, for the
general reader, the older <cite>Life of Joseph Addison</cite>, by Lucy
Aiken, 1846.</p>

<p><cite>The Life and Writings of Addison</cite>, by T. B. Macaulay.
Macaulay's familiar essay, which first appeared in the <cite>Edin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>burgh
Review</cite> for July, 1843, is still the best brief estimate,
though it rather exaggerates the merits both of Addison's
genius and his writings.</p>

<p><cite>The Lives of the Poets, Addison</cite>, by Samuel Johnson, 1781.
Judicious and sensible; of permanent value.</p>

<p><cite>Lectures on the English Humourists, Addison</cite>, by W. M.
Thackeray.</p>

<p><cite>Le Public et les Hommes de Lettres en Angleterre au XVIII<sup>e</sup>
SiÃ¨cle</cite>, par A. Beljame, 1881. This admirable work&mdash;which
unfortunately is not translated&mdash;contains a full account of
Addison's career, as well as an estimate of his work. The
bibliography in the Appendix is valuable.</p>


<p class="center">HISTORY</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Political</span></p>

<p><cite>The Age of Anne</cite>, by E. E. Morris, in the <cite>Epochs of Modern

of the history.</p>

<p><cite>A History of England in the Eighteenth Century</cite>, by W. E.
H. Lecky, 1878, Volume I. Perhaps the best account for the
general reader.</p>

<p><cite>A History of the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, by J. H. Burton,
3 volumes, 1880.</p>

<p><cite>The Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, by Justin McCarthy, two volumes,
1902. Contains, also, much valuable information upon

Chapter III. This famous chapter is still one of the best
accounts of social conditions in England at the end of the
seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p><cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, by John Ashton,
1882. This is the best account of dress, manners, amusements,
travel, trade, and all the details of social life; it is frequently
referred to in the notes of this volume.</p>

<p><cite>The Popular History of England</cite>, by Charles Knight (1859),
Volume V., Chapters XXVI-XXX.</p>

<p>Thackeray's <cite>Henry Esmond</cite>&mdash;perhaps the most remarkable
historical novel in the language&mdash;represents with wonderful
fidelity the very atmosphere of the Queen Anne time.</p>

<p>But, above all, the student who wishes to gain a sympathetic
acquaintance with the life of this most interesting period, and
to enter into its spirit, should read more of its literature&mdash;especially
the <cite>Tatler</cite> and <cite>Spectator</cite>, Swift's <cite>Journal to Stella</cite>,
Pope's <cite>Satires and Epistles</cite>, Gay's <cite>Trivia</cite>, and the <cite>Letters</cite> of

PAPERS</span></p>

<h2><a id="I_THE_SPECTATOR"></a>I. THE SPECTATOR</h2>



<p class="center">[No. 1. Thursday, March 1, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat.</span></div>

</div></div></div>

<p>I have observed that a reader seldom peruses a book
with pleasure till he knows whether the writer of it be a
black<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or a fair man, of a mild or choleric disposition,
married or a bachelor, with other particulars of the like
nature that conduce very much to the right understanding {<a href="#p45">5</a>}
of an author. To gratify this curiosity, which is so natural
to a reader, I design this paper and my next as prefatory
discourses to my following writings, and shall give some
account in them of the several persons that are engaged
in this work. As the chief trouble of compiling, digesting, {10}
and correcting will fall to my share, I must do myself
the justice to open the work with my own history. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
born to a small hereditary estate, which, according to the
tradition of the village where it lies, was bounded by the
same hedges and ditches in William the Conqueror's time
that it is at present, and has been delivered down from
father to son whole and entire, without the loss or acquisition {5}
of a single field or meadow, during the space of six
hundred years. There runs a story in the family, that
my mother ... dreamt that she was brought to bed of a
judge: whether this might proceed from a lawsuit which
was then depending<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in the family, or my father's being a {10}
justice of the peace, I cannot determine; for I am not
so vain as to think it presaged any dignity that I should
arrive at in my future life, though that was the interpretation
which the neighbourhood put upon it. The gravity
of my behaviour at my very first appearance in the world, {15}
and all the time that I sucked, seemed to favour my
mother's dream; for, as she had often told me, I threw
away my rattle before I was two months old, and would
not make use of my coral<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> till they had taken away the
bells from it. {20}</p>

<p>As for the rest of my infancy, there being nothing in it
remarkable, I shall pass it over in silence. I find that,
during my nonage,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I had the reputation of a very sullen
youth, but was always a favourite of my schoolmaster, who
used to say that my parts were solid and would wear well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> {25}
I had not been long at the university before I distinguished
myself by a most profound silence; for during
the space of eight years, excepting in the public exercises
of the college, I scarce uttered the quantity of an hundred
words; and indeed do not remember that I ever {<a href="#p47">5</a>}
spoke three sentences together in my whole life. Whilst
I was in this learned body, I applied myself with so much
diligence to my studies that there are very few celebrated
books, either in the learned or the modern tongues, which
I am not acquainted with. {10}</p>

<p>Upon the death of my father, I was resolved to travel
into foreign countries, and therefore left the university
with the character of an odd, unaccountable fellow, that
had a great deal of learning, if I would but show it. An
insatiable thirst after knowledge carried me into all the {15}
countries of Europe in which there was anything new or
strange to be seen; nay, to such a degree was my curiosity
raised, that having read the controversies of some
great men concerning the antiquities of Egypt, I made a
voyage to Grand Cairo on purpose to take the measure {20}
of a pyramid; and as soon as I had set myself right in
that particular, returned to my native country with great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>I have passed my latter years in this city, where I am
frequently seen in most public places, though there are {25}
not above half a dozen of my select friends that know
me; of whom my next paper shall give a more particular
account. There is no place of general resort wherein I
do not often make my appearance; sometimes I am seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
thrusting my head into a round of politicians at Will's,
and listening with great attention to the narratives that
are made in those little circular audiences. Sometimes I
smoke a pipe at Child's, and whilst I seem attentive to
nothing but the <cite>Postman</cite>, overhear the conversation of {<a href="#p48">5</a>}
every table in the room. I appear on Sunday nights at
St. James's Coffee-house, and sometimes join the little
committee of politics in the inner room, as one who
comes there to hear and improve. My face is likewise
very well known at the Grecian, the Cocoa Tree, and in {10}
the theatres both of Drury Lane and the Haymarket. I
have been taken for a merchant upon the Exchange for
above these ten years, and sometimes pass for a Jew in
the assembly of stockjobbers at Jonathan's. In short,
wherever I see a cluster of people, I always mix with {15}
them, though I never open my lips but in my own club.</p>

<p>Thus I live in the world rather as a Spectator of mankind
than as one of the species; by which means I have
made myself a speculative statesman, soldier, merchant,
and artisan, without ever meddling with any practical {20}
part in life. I am very well versed in the theory of an
husband or a father, and can discern the errors in the
economy, business, and diversion of others better than
those who are engaged in them: as standers-by discover
blots<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which are apt to escape those who are in the game. {25}
I never espoused any party with violence, and am resolved
to observe an exact neutrality between the Whigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and Tories, unless I shall be forced to declare myself by
the hostilities of either side. In short, I have acted in
all the parts of my life as a looker-on, which is the
character I intend to preserve in this paper.</p>

<p>I have given the reader just so much of my history and {5}
character as to let him see I am not altogether unqualified
for the business I have undertaken. As for other
particulars in my life and adventures, I shall insert them
in following papers as I shall see occasion. In the mean
time, when I consider how much I have seen, read, and {10}
heard, I begin to blame my own taciturnity: and since I
have neither time nor inclination to communicate the fulness
of my heart in speech, I am resolved to do it in
writing, and to print myself out, if possible, before I die.
I have been often told by my friends that it is pity so many {15}
useful discoveries which I have made, should be in the possession
of a silent man. For this reason, therefore, I shall
publish a sheetful of thoughts every morning for the benefit
of my contemporaries; and if I can any way contribute to
the diversion or improvement of the country in which I live, {20}
I shall leave it, when I am summoned out of it, with the
secret satisfaction of thinking that I have not lived in vain.</p>

<p>There are three very material points which I have not
spoken to in this paper, and which, for several important
reasons, I must keep to myself, at least for some time: I {25}
mean, an account of my name, my age, and my lodgings.
I must confess, I would gratify my reader in anything that
is reasonable; but, as for these three particulars, though
I am sensible they might tend very much to the embel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>lishment
of my paper, I cannot yet come to a resolution
of communicating them to the public. They would indeed
draw me out of that obscurity which I have enjoyed
for many years, and expose me in public places to several
salutes and civilities, which have been always very disagreeable {<a href="#p50">5</a>}
to me; for the greatest pain I can suffer is the
being talked to and being stared at. It is for this reason,
likewise, that I keep my complexion and dress as very
great secrets: though it is not impossible but I may make
discoveries<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of both in the progress of the work I have {10}
undertaken.</p>

<p>After having been thus particular upon myself, I shall
in to-morrow's paper give an account of those gentlemen
who are concerned with me in this work; for, as I have
before intimated, a plan of it is laid and concerted&mdash;as {15}
all other matters of importance are&mdash;in a club. However,
as my friends have engaged me to stand in the
front, those who have a mind to correspond with me may
direct their letters to the Spectator, at Mr. Buckley's in
Little Britain. For I must further acquaint the reader {20}
that, though our club meets only on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
we have appointed a committee to sit every night,
for the inspection of all such papers as may contribute to
the advancement of the public weal. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="II_THE_CLUB" id="II_THE_CLUB">II. THE CLUB</a></h2>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">No. 2.</span> Friday, March 2, 1711. <span class="smcap">Steele.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i12">Ast alii sex</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Et plures uno conclamant ore.</span></div>
<span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Juv.</span></span>
</div></div></div>


<p>The first of our society is a gentleman of Worcestershire,
of ancient descent, a baronet, his name Sir Roger
de Coverley. His great-grandfather was inventor of that
famous country-dance which is called after him. All who
know that shire are very well acquainted with the parts {<a href="#p51">5</a>}
and merits of Sir Roger. He is a gentleman that is very
singular in his behaviour, but his singularities proceed
from his good sense, and are contradictions to the manners
of the world only as he thinks the world is in the wrong.
However, this humour creates him no enemies, for he does {10}
nothing with sourness or obstinacy; and his being unconfined
to modes and forms, makes him but the readier
and more capable<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to please and oblige all who know
him. When he is in town, he lives in Soho Square. It
is said he keeps himself a bachelor by reason he was {15}
crossed in love by a perverse, beautiful widow of the next
county to him. Before this disappointment, Sir Roger
was what you call a fine gentleman; had often supped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
with my Lord Rochester and Sir George Etherege, fought
a duel upon his first coming to town, and kicked Bully
Dawson in a public coffee-house for calling him "youngster."
But being ill-used by the above-mentioned widow,
he was very serious for a year and a half; and though, {<a href="#p52">5</a>}
his temper being naturally jovial, he at last got over it, he
grew careless of himself, and never dressed afterwards.
He continues to wear a coat and doublet of the same cut
that were in fashion at the time of his repulse, which,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in
his merry humours, he tells us, has been in and out twelve {10}
times since he first wore it.... He is now in his fifty-sixth
year, cheerful, gay, and hearty; keeps a good house
both in town and country; a great lover of mankind;
but there is such a mirthful cast in his behaviour that he is
rather beloved than esteemed. His tenants grow rich, {15}
his servants look satisfied, all the young women profess
love to him, and the young men are glad of his company.
When he comes into a house, he calls the servants by
their names, and talks all the way up-stairs to a visit. I
must not omit that Sir Roger is a justice of the quorum;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> {20}
that he fills the chair at a quarter session<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> with great
abilities; and, three months ago, gained universal applause
by explaining a passage in the Game Act.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>The gentleman next in esteem and authority among us
is another bachelor, who is a member of the Inner Temple;
a man of great probity, wit, and understanding;
but he has chosen his place of residence rather to obey
the direction of an old humoursome father, than in pursuit {<a href="#p53">5</a>}
of his own inclinations. He was placed there to
study the laws of the land, and is the most learned of
any of the house in those of the stage. Aristotle and
Longinus are much better understood by him than Littleton
or Coke. The father sends up, every post, questions {10}
relating to marriage-articles, leases, and tenures, in the
neighborhood; all which questions he agrees with an
attorney to answer and take care of in the lump. He is
studying the passions themselves, when he should be
inquiring into the debates among men which arise from {15}
them. He knows the argument of each of the orations
of Demosthenes and Tully but not one case in the reports
of our own courts. No one ever took him for a fool, but
none, except his intimate friends, know he has a great
deal of wit. This turn makes him at once both disinterested {20}
and agreeable; as few of his thoughts are drawn
from business, they are most of them fit for conversation.
His taste of books is a little too just for the age he lives
in; he has read all, but approves of very few. His
familiarity with the customs, manners, actions, and writings {25}
of the ancients makes him a very delicate observer
of what occurs to him in the present world. He is an
excellent critic, and the time of the play is his hour of
business; exactly at five he passes through New Inn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
crosses through Russell Court, and takes a turn at Will's
till the play begins; he has his shoes rubbed and his
periwig powdered at the barber's as you go into the
Rose. It is for the good of the audience when he is at
a play, for the actors have an ambition to please him. {<a href="#p54">5</a>}</p>

<p>The person of next consideration is Sir Andrew Freeport,
a merchant of great eminence in the city of London;
a person of indefatigable industry, strong reason, and great
experience. His notions of trade are noble and generous,
and&mdash;as every rich man has usually some sly way of {10}
jesting which would make no great figure were he not
a rich man&mdash;he calls the sea the British Common. He
is acquainted with commerce in all its parts, and will
tell you that it is a stupid and barbarous way to extend
dominion by arms; for true power is to be got by arts and {15}
industry. He will often argue that if this part of our trade
were well cultivated, we should gain from one nation; and
if another, from another. I have heard him prove that
diligence makes more lasting acquisitions than valour, and
that sloth has ruined more nations than the sword. He {20}
abounds in several frugal maxims, amongst which the
greatest favourite is, "A penny saved is a penny got."
A general trader of good sense is pleasanter company
than a general scholar; and Sir Andrew having a natural,
unaffected eloquence, the perspicuity of his discourse {25}
gives the same pleasure that wit would in another man.
He has made his fortunes himself, and says that England
may be richer than other kingdoms by as plain methods
as he himself is richer than other men; though at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
same time I can say this of him, that there is not a point
in the compass but blows home a ship in which he is an
owner.</p>

<p>Next to Sir Andrew in the club-room sits Captain
Sentry, a gentleman of great courage, good understanding, {5}
but invincible modesty. He is one of those that deserve
very well, but are very awkward at putting their talents
within the observation of such as should take notice of
them. He was some years a captain, and behaved himself
with great gallantry in several engagements and at {10}
several sieges; but having a small estate of his own, and
being next heir to Sir Roger, he has quitted a way of
life in which no man can rise suitably to his merit who
is not something of a courtier as well as a soldier.
I have heard him often lament that in a profession {15}
where merit is placed in so conspicuous a view, impudence
should get the better of modesty. When he has
talked to this purpose I never heard him make a sour
expression, but frankly confess that he left the world
because he was not fit for it. A strict honesty and an {20}
even, regular behaviour are in themselves obstacles to him
that must press through crowds who endeavour at the same
end with himself,&mdash;the favour of a commander. He will,
however, in his way of talk, excuse generals for not
disposing<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> according to men's desert, or inquiring into it. {25}
"For," says he, "that great man who has a mind to help
me, has as many to break through to come at me as I
have to come at him"; therefore he will conclude that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the man who would make a figure, especially in a military
way, must get over all false modesty, and assist his patron
against the importunity of other pretenders by a proper
assurance in his own vindication.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He says it is a civil
cowardice to be backward in asserting what you ought to {5}
expect, as it is a military fear to be slow in attacking when
it is your duty. With this candour does the gentleman
speak of himself and others. The same frankness runs
through all his conversation. The military part of his
life has furnished him with many adventures, in the relation {10}
of which he is very agreeable to the company; for
he is never overbearing, though accustomed to command
men in the utmost degree below him; nor ever too
obsequious from an habit of obeying men highly above
him. {15}</p>

<p>But that our society may not appear a set of humorists
unacquainted with the gallantries and pleasures of the age,
we have among us the gallant Will Honeycomb, a gentleman
who, according to his years, should be in the decline
of his life, but having<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> ever been very careful of his person, {20}
and always had a very easy fortune, time has made but
very little impression either by wrinkles on his forehead
or traces in his brain. His person is well turned, of a
good height. He is very ready at that sort of discourse
with which men usually entertain women. He has all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> {25}
life dressed very well, and remembers habits<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as others do
men. He can smile when one speaks to him, and laughs
easily. He knows the history of every mode,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and can
inform you from which of the French king's wenches our
wives and daughters had this manner of curling their hair, {<a href="#p57">5</a>}
that way of placing their hoods; ... and whose vanity to
show her foot made that part of the dress so short in such
a year. In a word, all his conversation and knowledge
has been in the female world. As other men of his age
will take notice to you<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> what such a minister said upon {10}
such and such an occasion, he will tell you when the
Duke of Monmouth danced at court such a woman was
then smitten, another was taken with him at the head of
his troop in the Park. In all these important relations,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
he has ever about the same time received a kind glance {15}
or a blow of a fan from some celebrated beauty, mother
of the present Lord Such-a-one. If you speak of a young
commoner that said a lively thing in the House, he starts
up: "He has good blood in his veins; ... that young
fellow's mother used me more like a dog than any woman {20}
I ever made advances to." This way of talking of his
very much enlivens the conversation among us of a more
sedate turn; and I find there is not one of the company
but myself, who rarely speak at all, but speaks of him as
of that sort of man who is usually called a well-bred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> {25}
fine gentleman. To conclude his character, where
women are not concerned, he is an honest, worthy
man.</p>
<p>I cannot tell whether I am to account him whom I am
next to speak of as one of our company, for he visits us {<a href="#p58">5</a>}
but seldom; but when he does, it adds to every man else
a new enjoyment of himself. He is a clergyman, a very
philosophic man, of general learning, great sanctity of
life, and the most exact good breeding. He has the
misfortune to be of a very weak constitution, and consequently {10}
cannot accept of such cares and business as
preferments in his function would oblige him to; he is
therefore among divines what a chamber-counsellor is
among lawyers. The probity of his mind and the integrity
of his life create him followers, as being eloquent or {15}
loud advances others. He seldom introduces the subject
he speaks upon; but we are so far gone in years
that he observes, when he is among us, an earnestness to
have him fall on some divine topic, which he always treats
with much authority, as one who has no interests in this {20}
world, as one who is hastening to the object of all his
wishes, and conceives hope from his decays and infirmities.
These are my ordinary companions.</p>

<h2><a name="III_SIR_ROGERS_CRITICISMS_ON_POLITE" id="III_SIR_ROGERS_CRITICISMS_ON_POLITE">III. SIR ROGER'S CRITICISMS ON POLITE
SOCIETY</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 6. Wednesday, March 7, 1711. <span class="smcap">Steele.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Credebant hoc grande nefas et morte piandum,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Si iuvenis vetulo non assurrexerat.</span></div>
<span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Juv.</span></span>
</div></div></div>


<p>I know no evil under the sun so great as the abuse of
the understanding, and yet there is no one vice more
common. It has diffused itself through both sexes and
all qualities of mankind, and there is hardly that person
to be found who is not more concerned for the reputation {<a href="#p59">5</a>}
of wit and sense, than honesty and virtue. But this unhappy
affectation of being wise rather than honest, witty
than good-natured, is the source of most of the ill habits
of life. Such false impressions are owing to the abandoned
writings of men of wit, and the awkward imitation {10}
of the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>For this reason, Sir Roger was saying last night that
he was of opinion none but men of fine parts deserve
to be hanged. The reflections of such men are so delicate
upon all occurrences which they are concerned in, {15}
that they should be exposed to more than ordinary infamy
and punishment for offending against such quick admonitions
as their own souls give them, and blunting the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
edge of their minds in such a manner that they are no
more shocked at vice and folly than men of slower capacities.
There is no greater monster in being, than a very
ill man of great parts. He lives like a man in a palsy,
with one side of him dead. While perhaps he enjoys the {<a href="#Page_60">5</a>}
satisfaction of luxury, of wealth, of ambition, he has lost
the taste of good-will, of friendship, of innocence. Scarecrow,
the beggar in Lincoln's Inn Fields, who disabled
himself in his right leg, and asks alms all day to get himself
a warm supper ... at night, is not half so despicable {10}
a wretch as such a man of sense. The beggar has no
relish above sensations; he finds rest more agreeable
than motion, and while he has a warm fire ..., never
reflects that he deserves to be whipped.</p>

<p>"Every man who terminates his satisfactions and enjoyments {15}
within the supply of his own necessities and passions,
is," says Sir Roger, "in my eye, as poor a rogue as
Scarecrow. But," continued he, "for the loss of public
and private virtue we are beholden to your men of parts,
forsooth; it is with them no matter what is done, so it is {20}
done with an air. But to me, who am so whimsical in a
corrupt age as to act according to nature and reason,
a selfish man in the most shining circumstance and equipage,
appears in the same condition with the fellow above-mentioned,
but more contemptible in proportion to what {25}
more he robs the public of and enjoys above him.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> I lay
it down therefore for a rule, that the whole man is to
move together; that every action of any importance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to have a prospect of public good; and that the general
tendency of our indifferent actions ought to be agreeable
to the dictates of reason, of religion, of good-breeding.
Without this, a man, as I have before hinted, is hopping
instead of walking; he is not in his entire and proper {<a href="#p61">5</a>}
motion."</p>

<p>While the honest knight was thus bewildering himself
in good starts,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> I looked intentively<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> upon him, which
made him, I thought, collect his mind a little. "What I
aim at," says he, "is to represent that I am of opinion, {10}
to polish our understandings and neglect our manners<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is
of all things the most inexcusable. Reason should govern
passion, but instead of that, you see, it is often subservient
to it; and, as unaccountable as one would think
it, a wise man is not always a good man." {15}</p>

<p>This degeneracy is not only the guilt of particular persons,
but also at some times of a whole people; and
perhaps it may appear upon examination that the most
polite ages are the least virtuous. This may be attributed
to the folly of admitting wit and learning as merit in {20}
themselves, without considering the application of them.
By this means it becomes a rule not so much to regard
what we do, as how we do it. But this false beauty will
not pass upon men of honest minds and true taste. Sir
Richard Blackmore says, with as much good sense as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> {25}
virtue,&mdash;"It is a mighty dishonour and shame to employ
excellent faculties and abundance of wit, to humour and
please men in their vices and follies. The great enemy
of mankind, notwithstanding his wit and angelic faculties,
is the most odious being in the whole creation." He goes {<a href="#p65">5</a>}
on soon after to say, very generously, that he undertook
the writing of his poem "to rescue the Muses, ... to
restore them to their sweet and chaste mansions, and to
engage them in an employment suitable to their dignity."
This certainly ought to be the purpose of every man who {10}
appears in public; and whoever does not proceed upon
that foundation, injures his country as fast as he succeeds
in his studies. When modesty ceases to be the chief
ornament of one sex and integrity of the other, society
is upon a wrong basis, and we shall be ever after without {15}
rules to guide our judgment in what is really becoming
and ornamental. Nature and reason direct one thing,
passion and humour another. To follow the dictates of
the two latter, is going into a road that is both endless
and intricate; when we pursue the other, our passage is {20}
delightful, and what we aim at easily attainable.</p>

<p>I do not doubt but England is at present as polite a
nation as any in the world; but any man who thinks can
easily see that the affectation of being gay and in fashion
has very near eaten up our good sense and our religion. {25}
Is there anything so just, as that mode<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and gallantry<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
should be built upon exerting ourselves in what is proper
and agreeable to the institutions of justice and piety
among us? And yet is there anything more common,
than that we run in perfect contradiction to them? All
which is supported by no other pretension than that it {5}
is done with what we call a good grace.</p>

<p>Nothing ought to be held laudable or becoming, but
what nature itself should prompt us to think so. Respect
to all kind of superiors is founded, methinks, upon instinct;
and yet what is so ridiculous as age?<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I make {10}
this abrupt transition to the mention of this vice<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> more
than any other, in order to introduce a little story, which
I think a pretty instance that the most polite age is in
danger of being the most vicious.</p>

<p>It happened at Athens, during a public representation {15}
of some play exhibited in honor of the commonwealth,
that an old gentleman came too late for a place suitable
to his age and quality. Many of the young gentlemen
who observed the difficulty and confusion he was in,
made signs to him that they would accommodate him if {20}
he came where they sat. The good man bustled through
the crowd accordingly; but when he came to the seats
to which he was invited, the jest was to sit close and
expose him, as he stood out of countenance, to the
whole audience. The frolic went round all the Athenian {25}
benches. But on those occasions there were also particular
places assigned for foreigners. When the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
man skulked towards the boxes appointed for the Lacedemonians,
that honest people, more virtuous than polite,
rose up all, to a man, and with the greatest respect
received him among them. The Athenians, being suddenly
touched with a sense of the Spartan virtue and {5}
their own degeneracy, gave a thunder of applause; and
the old man cried out, "The Athenians understand what
is good, but the Lacedemonians practise it!" </p>

<h2><a name="IV_THE_CLUB_AND_THE_SPECTATOR" id="IV_THE_CLUB_AND_THE_SPECTATOR">IV. THE CLUB AND THE SPECTATOR</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 34. Monday, April 9, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="i16">Parcit</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Cognatis maculis similis fera&mdash;</span></div>

</div></div></div>


<p>The club of which I am a member is very luckily composed
of such persons as are engaged in different ways {10}
of life, and deputed, as it were, out of the most conspicuous
classes of mankind. By this means I am furnished
with the greatest variety of hints and materials, and know
everything that passes in the different quarters and divisions,
not only of this great city, but of the whole kingdom. {15}
My readers, too, have the satisfaction to find that
there is no rank or degree among them who have not
their<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> representative in this club, and that there is always
somebody present who will take care of their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
interests, that nothing may be written or published to
the prejudice or infringement of their just rights and
privileges.</p>

<p>I last night sat very late in company with this select
body of friends, who entertained me with several remarks {5}
which they and others had made upon these my speculations,
as also with the various success which they<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> had
met with among their several ranks and degrees of
readers. Will Honeycomb told me, in the softest manner
he could, that there were some ladies&mdash;"but for {10}
your comfort," says Will, "they are not those of the
most wit"&mdash;that were offended at the liberties I had
taken with the opera and the puppet-show; that some of
them were likewise very much surprised that I should
think such serious points as the dress and equipage of {15}
persons of quality proper subjects for raillery.</p>

<p>He was going on, when Sir Andrew Freeport took him
up short, and told him that the papers he hinted at had
done great good in the city, and that all their<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> wives and
daughters were the better for them; and further added, {20}
that the whole city thought themselves very much obliged
to me for declaring my generous intentions to scourge
vice and folly as they appear in a multitude, without condescending
to be a publisher of particular intrigues. "In
short," says Sir Andrew, "if you avoid that foolish beaten {25}
road of falling upon aldermen and citizens, and employ
your pen upon the vanity and luxury of courts, your paper
must needs be of general use."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this my friend the Templar told Sir Andrew that
he wondered to hear a man of his sense talk after that
manner; that the city had always been the province for
satire; and that the wits of King Charles's time jested
upon nothing else during his whole reign. He then {<a href="#p66">5</a>}
showed, by the examples of Horace, Juvenal, Boileau,
and the best writers of every age, that the follies of the
stage and court had never been accounted too sacred for
ridicule, how great soever the persons might be that patronized
them. "But after all," says he, "I think your {10}
raillery has made too great an excursion, in attacking
several persons of the Inns of Court; and I do not
believe you can show me any precedent for your behaviour
in that particular."</p>

<p>My good friend Sir Roger de Coverley, who had said {15}
nothing all this while, began his speech with a "Pish!"
and told us that he wondered to see so many men of
sense so very serious upon fooleries. "Let our good
friend," says he, "attack every one that deserves it; I
would only advise you, Mr. Spectator,"&mdash;applying himself {20}
to me,&mdash;"to take care how you meddle with country
squires. They are the ornaments of the English
nation,&mdash;men of good heads and sound bodies! and,
let me tell you, some of them take it ill of you that you
mention fox hunters with so little respect." {25}</p>

<p>Captain Sentry spoke very sparingly on this occasion.
What he said was only to commend my prudence in not
touching upon the army, and advised me to continue to
act discreetly in that point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time I found every subject of my speculations
was taken away from me by one or other of the club, and
began to think myself in the condition of the good man
that had one wife who took a dislike to his gray hairs, and
another to his black, till by their picking out what each {<a href="#p67">5</a>}
of them had an aversion to, they left his head altogether
bald and naked.</p>

<p>While I was thus musing with myself, my worthy friend
the clergyman, who, very luckily for me, was at the club
that night, undertook my cause. He told us that he wondered {10}
any order of persons should think themselves too
considerable to be advised. That it was not quality, but
innocence, which exempted men from reproof. That vice
and folly ought to be attacked wherever they could be
met with, and especially when they were placed in high {15}
and conspicuous stations of life. He further added, that
my paper would only serve to aggravate the pains of poverty,
if it chiefly exposed those who are already depressed,
and in some measure turned into ridicule, by the meanness
of their conditions and circumstances. He afterwards {20}
proceeded to take notice of the great use this
paper might be of to the public, by reprehending those
vices which are too trivial for the chastisement of the
law, and too fantastical for the cognizance of the pulpit.
He then advised me to prosecute my undertaking with {25}
cheerfulness, and assured me, that whoever might be displeased
with me, I should be approved by all those
whose praises do honour to the persons on whom they
are bestowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole club pays a particular deference to the discourse
of this gentleman, and are drawn into what he
says, as much by the candid, ingenuous manner with
which he delivers himself, as by the strength of argument
and force of reason which he makes use of. Will Honeycomb {<a href="#p68">5</a>}
immediately agreed that what he had said was right,
and that, for his part, he would not insist upon the quarter
which he had demanded for the ladies. Sir Andrew gave
up the city with the same frankness. The Templar would
not stand out, and was followed by Sir Roger and the {10}
Captain,&mdash;who all agreed that I should be at liberty to
carry the war into what quarter I pleased, provided I continued
to combat with criminals in a body, and to assault
the vice without hurting the person.</p>

<p>This debate, which was held for the good of mankind, {15}
put me in mind of that which the Roman triumvirate were
formerly engaged in for their destruction. Every man at
first stood hard for his friend, till they found that by this
means they should spoil their proscription; and at length,
making a sacrifice of all their acquaintance and relations, {20}
furnished out a very decent execution.</p>

<p>Having thus taken my resolutions to march on boldly
in the cause of virtue and good sense, and to annoy their
adversaries in whatever degree or rank of men they may
be found, I shall be deaf for the future to all the remonstrances {25}
that shall be made to me on this account. If
Punch grows extravagant, I shall reprimand him very
freely. If the stage becomes a nursery of folly and
impertinence, I shall not be afraid to animadvert upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
In short, if I meet with anything in city, court, or country,
that shocks modesty or good manners, I shall use my
utmost endeavours to make an example of it. I must,
however, intreat every particular person who does me the
honour to be a reader of this paper, never to think himself, {<a href="#p69">5</a>}
or any one of his friends or enemies, aimed at in what is
said: for I promise him, never to draw a faulty character
which does not fit at least a thousand people; or to
publish a single paper that is not written in the spirit of
benevolence and with a love to mankind. {10}</p>

<h2><a name="V_A_LADYS_LIBRARY" id="V_A_LADYS_LIBRARY">V. A LADY'S LIBRARY</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 37. Thursday, April 12, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>Some months ago, my friend Sir Roger, being in the
country, enclosed a letter to me, directed to a certain
lady whom I shall here call by the name of Leonora, and
as it contained matters of consequence, desired me to
deliver it to her with my own hand. Accordingly I waited {15}
upon her ladyship pretty early in the morning, and was
desired by her woman to walk into her lady's library, till
such time as she was in a readiness to receive me. The
very sound of "a lady's library" gave me a great curiosity
to see it; and as it was some time before the lady came {20}<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
to me, I had an opportunity of turning over a great many
of her books, which were ranged together in a very beautiful
order. At the end of the folios, which were finely
bound and gilt, were great jars of china placed one above
another in a very noble piece of architecture. The quartos {<a href="#p70">5</a>}
were separated from the octavos by a pile of smaller
vessels, which rose in a delightful pyramid. The octavos
were bounded by tea-dishes of all shapes, colours, and
sizes, which were so disposed on a wooden frame that
they looked like one continued pillar indented with the {10}
finest strokes of sculpture and stained with the greatest
variety of dyes.</p>

<p>That part of the library which was designed for the
reception of plays and pamphlets, and other loose papers,
was enclosed in a kind of square, consisting of one of the {15}
prettiest grotesque works that ever I saw, and made up
of scaramouches, lions, monkeys, mandarins, trees, shells,
and a thousand other odd figures in china ware. In the
midst of the room was a little japan table, with a quire of
gilt paper upon it, and on the paper a silver snuff box {20}
made in the shape of a little book. I found there were
several other counterfeit books upon the upper shelves,
which were carved in wood, and served only to fill up the
number, like fagots<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> in the muster of a regiment. I was
wonderfully pleased with such a mixed kind of furniture {25}
as seemed very suitable both to the lady and the scholar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>and did not know, at first, whether I should fancy myself
in a grotto or in a library.</p>

<p>Upon my looking into the books, I found there were
some few which the lady had bought for her own use;
but that most of them had been got together, either because {<a href="#p71">5</a>}
she had heard them praised, or because she had
seen the authors of them. Among several that I examined,
I very well remember these that follow:</p>

<p>Ogilby's <cite>Virgil</cite>.</p>

<p>Dryden's <cite>Juvenal</cite>. {10}</p>

<p><cite>Cassandra</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Cleopatra</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Astraea</cite>.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton's Works.</p>

<p><cite>The Grand Cyrus</cite>, with a pin stuck in one of the {15}
middle leaves.</p>

<p>Pembroke's <cite>Arcadia</cite>.</p>

<p>Locke of <cite>Human Understanding</cite>, with a paper of
patches in it.</p>

<p>A spelling book. {20}</p>

<p>A dictionary for the explanation of hard words.</p>

<p>Sherlock upon <cite>Death</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>The Fifteen Comforts of Matrimony</cite>.</p>

<p>Sir William Temple's <cite>Essays</cite>.</p>

<p>Father Malebranche's <cite>Search after Truth</cite>, translated {25}
into English.</p>

<p>A book of novels.</p>

<p><cite>The Academy of Compliments</cite>.</p>

<p>Culpepper's <cite>Midwifery</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>The Ladies' Calling</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Tales in Verse</cite>, by Mr. D'Urfey; bound in red leather,
gilt on the back, and doubled down in several places.</p>

<p>All the classic authors in wood.</p>

<p>A set of Elzevirs by the same hand. {<a href="#p72">5</a>}</p>

<p><cite>Clelia</cite>, which opened of itself in the place that describes
two lovers in a bower.</p>

<p>Baker's <cite>Chronicle</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Advice to a Daughter</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>The New Atalantis</cite>, with a key to it. {10}</p>

<p>Mr. Steele's <cite>Christian Hero</cite>.</p>

<p>A prayer-book; with a bottle of Hungary water by the
side of it.</p>

<p>Dr. Sacheverell's Speech.</p>

<p>Fielding's Trial. {15}</p>

<p>Seneca's <cite>Morals</cite>.</p>

<p>Taylor's <cite>Holy Living and Dying</cite>.</p>

<p>La Ferte's <cite>Instructions for Country Dances</cite>.</p>

<p>I was taking a catalogue in my pocket-book of these
and several other authors, when Leonora entered, and {20}
upon my presenting her with the letter from the knight,
told me, with an unspeakable grace, that she hoped Sir
Roger was in good health. I answered, "Yes," for I
hate long speeches, and after a bow or two retired.</p>

<p>Leonora was formerly a celebrated beauty, and is still {25}
a very lovely woman. She has been a widow for two or
three years, and being unfortunate in her first marriage,
has taken a resolution never to venture upon a second.
She has no children to take care of, and leaves the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>agement
of her estate to my good friend Sir Roger. But
as the mind naturally sinks into a kind of lethargy, and
falls asleep, that<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is not agitated by some favourite pleasures
and pursuits, Leonora has turned all the passions of
her sex into a love of books and retirement. She converses {5}
chiefly with men,&mdash;as she has often said herself,&mdash;but
it is only in their writings; and admits of very few
male visitants except my friend Sir Roger, whom she
hears with great pleasure and without scandal.</p>

<p>As her reading has lain very much among romances, {10}
it has given her a very particular turn of thinking, and
discovers itself even in her house, her gardens, and her
furniture. Sir Roger has entertained me an hour together
with a description of her country seat, which is situated
in a kind of wilderness, about an hundred miles distant {15}
from London, and looks like a little enchanted palace.
The rocks about her are shaped into artificial grottoes
covered with woodbines and jessamines. The woods are
cut into shady walks, twisted into bowers, and filled with
cages of turtles.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The springs are made to run among pebbles, {20}
and by that means taught to murmur very agreeably.
They are likewise collected into a beautiful lake that is
inhabited by a couple of swans, and empties itself by a
little rivulet which runs through a green meadow, and is
known in the family by the name of the Purling Stream. {25}</p>

<p>The knight likewise tells me that this lady preserves
her game better than any of the gentlemen in the country.
"Not," says Sir Roger, "that she sets so great a value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
upon her partridges and pheasants, as upon her larks and
nightingales; for she says that every bird which is killed
in her ground will spoil a consort,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and that she shall
certainly miss him the next year."</p>

<p>When I think how oddly this lady is improved by {<a href="#p74">5</a>}
learning, I look upon her with a mixture of admiration
and pity. Amidst these innocent entertainments which
she has formed to herself, how much more valuable does
she appear than those of her sex who employ themselves
in diversions that are less reasonable, though more in {10}
fashion. What improvements would a woman have
made, who is so susceptible of impressions from what
she reads, had she been guided to such books as have a
tendency to enlighten the understanding and rectify the
passions, as well as to those which are of little more use {15}
than to divert the imagination.</p>

<p>But the manner of a lady's employing herself usefully
in reading shall be the subject of another paper, in which
I design to recommend such particular books as may be
proper for the improvement of the sex. And as this is a {20}
subject of a very nice nature, I shall desire my correspondents
to give me their thoughts upon it.</p>

<p>Having often received an invitation from my friend
Sir Roger de Coverley to pass away a month with him in
the country, I last week accompanied him thither, and
am settled with him for some time at his country house,
where I intend to form several of my ensuing speculations. {5}
Sir Roger, who is very well acquainted with my
humor, lets me rise and go to bed when I please, dine at
his own table or in my chamber, as I think fit, sit still
and say nothing without bidding me be merry. When
the gentlemen of the country come to see him, he only {10}
shows me at a distance. As I have been walking in his
fields I have observed them stealing a sight of me over
an hedge, and have heard the knight desiring them not
to let me see them, for that I hated to be stared at.</p>

<p>I am the more at ease in Sir Roger's family because it {15}
consists of sober and staid persons; for, as the knight is
the best master in the world, he seldom changes his servants;
and as he is beloved by all about him, his servants
never care for leaving him; by this means his domestics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
are all in years, and grown old with their master. You
would take his <i lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> for his brother, his butler
is gray-headed, his groom is one of the gravest men that
I have ever seen, and his coachman has the looks of a
privy counsellor. You see the goodness of the master {5}
even in the old house dog, and in a gray pad<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that is
kept in the stable with great care and tenderness out of
regard to his past services, though he has been useless
for several years.</p>

<p>I could not but observe with a great deal of pleasure {10}
the joy that appeared in the countenances of these
ancient domestics upon my friend's arrival at his country
seat. Some of them could not refrain from tears at the
sight of their old master; every one of them pressed forward
to do something for him, and seemed discouraged {15}
if they were not employed. At the same time the good
old knight, with a mixture of the father and the master
of the family, tempered the inquiries after his own affairs
with several kind questions relating to themselves. This
humanity and good nature engages everybody to him, so {20}
that when he is pleasant upon any of them, all his family
are in good humour, and none so much as the person
whom he diverts himself with; on the contrary, if he
coughs, or betrays any infirmity of old age, it is easy for
a stander-by to observe a secret concern in the looks of {25}
all of his servants.</p>

<p>My worthy friend has put me under the particular care
of his butler, who is a very prudent man, and, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the rest of his fellow-servants, wonderfully desirous of
pleasing me, because they have often heard their master
talk of me as of his particular friend.</p>

<p>My chief companion, when Sir Roger is diverting himself
in the woods or the fields, is a very venerable man {<a href="#Page_77">5</a>}
who is ever with Sir Roger, and has lived at his house in
the nature<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> of a chaplain above thirty years. This gentleman
is a person of good sense and some learning, of a
very regular life and obliging conversation; he heartily
loves Sir Roger, and knows that he is very much in the {10}
old knight's esteem, so that he lives in the family rather
as a relation than a dependant.</p>

<p>I have observed in several of my papers, that my friend
Sir Roger, amidst all his good qualities, is something of
an humorist,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and that his virtues as well as imperfections {15}
are, as it were, tinged by a certain extravagance which
makes them particularly <em>his</em>, and distinguishes them from
those of other men. This cast of mind, as it is generally
very innocent in itself, so it renders his conversation
highly agreeable, and more delightful than the same {20}
degree of sense and virtue would appear in their common
and ordinary colours. As I was walking with him last
night, he asked me how I liked the good man whom I
have just now mentioned; and without staying for my
answer, told me that he was afraid of being insulted with {25}
Latin and Greek at <em>his</em> own table, for which reason he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
desired a particular friend of his at the university to find
him out a clergyman, rather of plain sense than much
learning, of a good aspect, a clear voice, a sociable temper,
and, if possible, a man that understood a little of
backgammon. "My friend," says Sir Roger, "found {5}
me out this gentleman, who, besides the endowments
required of him, is, they tell me, a good scholar, though
he does not show it. I have given him the parsonage
of the parish, and, because I know his value, have settled
upon him a good annuity for life. If he outlives me, he {10}
shall find that he was higher in my esteem than perhaps
he thinks he is. He has now been with me thirty years,
and though he does not know I have taken notice of it,
has never in all that time asked anything of me for himself,
though he is every day soliciting me for something {15}
in behalf of one or other of my tenants, his parishioners.
There has not been a lawsuit in the parish since he has
lived among them: if any dispute arises they apply themselves
to him for the decision; if they do not acquiesce
in his judgment,&mdash;which I think never happened above {20}
once or twice at most,&mdash;they appeal to me. At his first
settling with me, I made him a present of all the good
sermons which have been printed in English, and only
begged of him that every Sunday he would pronounce
one of them in the pulpit. Accordingly he has digested {25}
them into such a series that they follow one another
naturally, and make a continued system of practical
divinity."</p>

<p>As Sir Roger was going on in his story, the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
we were talking of came up to us; and upon the knight's
asking him who preached to-morrow (for it was Saturday
night), told us the Bishop of St. Asaph in the morning
and Dr. South in the afternoon. He then showed us his
list of preachers for the whole year, where I saw, with {<a href="#p79">5</a>}
a great deal of pleasure, Archbishop Tillotson, Bishop
Saunderson, Dr. Barrow, Dr. Calamy, with several living
authors who have published discourses of practical divinity.
I no sooner saw this venerable man in the pulpit
but I very much approved of my friend's insisting upon {10}
the qualifications of a good aspect and a clear voice; for
I was so charmed with the gracefulness of his figure and
delivery, as well as with the discourses he pronounced,
that I think I never passed any time more to my satisfaction.
A sermon repeated after this manner is like the {15}
composition of a poet in the mouth of a graceful actor.
I could heartily wish that more of our country clergy
would follow this example; and instead of wasting their
spirits in laborious compositions of their own, would endeavor
after a handsome elocution, and all those other {20}
talents that are proper to enforce what has been penned
by greater masters. This would not only be more easy
to themselves, but more edifying to the people.</p>

<p class="center">[No. 107. Tuesday, July 3, 1711. <span class="smcap">Steele.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">&AElig;sopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Servumque collocarunt aeterna in basi,</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Phaed.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>The reception, manner of attendance, undisturbed freedom
and quiet, which I meet with here in the country,
has confirmed me in the opinion I always had, that the
general corruption of manners in servants is owing to the
conduct of masters. The aspect of every one in the family {<a href="#Page_80">5</a>}
carries so much satisfaction that it appears he knows
the happy lot which has befallen him in being a member
of it. There is one particular which I have seldom seen
but at Sir Roger's: it is usual in all other places that
servants fly from the parts of the house through which {10}
their master is passing; on the contrary, here, they industriously
place themselves in his way; and it is on both
sides, as it were, understood as a visit, when the servants
appear without calling. This proceeds from the humane
and equal temper of the man of the house, who also perfectly {15}
well knows how to enjoy a great estate with such
economy as ever to be much beforehand. This makes
his own mind untroubled, and consequently unapt to
vent peevish expressions, or give passionate or inconsist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ent
orders to those about him. Thus respect and love
go together; and a certain cheerfulness in performance
of their duty is the particular distinction of the lower
part of this family. When a servant is called before his
master, he does not come with an expectation to hear {5}
himself rated for some trivial fault, threatened to be
stripped,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> or used with any other unbecoming language,
which mean masters often give to worthy servants: but
it is often to know what road he took that he came so
readily back according to order; whether he passed by {10}
such a ground; if the old man who rents it is in good
health; or whether he gave Sir Roger's love to him, or
the like.</p>

<p>A man who preserves a respect founded on his benevolence
to his dependants lives rather like a prince than a {15}
master in his family; his orders are received as favours
rather than duties; and the distinction of approaching
him is part of the reward for executing what is commanded
by him.</p>

<p>There is another circumstance in which my friend excels {20}
in his management, which is the manner of rewarding
his servants. He has ever been of opinion that
giving his cast<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> clothes to be worn by valets has a very
ill effect upon little minds, and creates a silly sense of
equality between the parties, in persons affected only {25}
with outward things. I have heard him often pleasant
on this occasion,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and describe a young gentleman abus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ing
his man in that coat<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which a month or two before
was the most pleasing distinction he was conscious of in
himself. He would turn his discourse still more pleasantly
upon the ladies' bounties of this kind; and I have
heard him say he knew a fine woman who distributed {5}
rewards and punishments in giving becoming or unbecoming
dresses to her maids.</p>

<p>But my good friend is above these little instances of
good-will, in bestowing only trifles on his servants; a
good servant to him is sure of having it in his choice very {10}
soon of being no servant at all. As I before observed,
he is so good an husband,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and knows so thoroughly that
the skill of the purse is the cardinal virtue of this life,&mdash;I
say, he knows so well that frugality is the support of
generosity, that he can often spare a large fine<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> when a {15}
tenement falls,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and give that settlement to a good servant
who has a mind to go into the world, or make a stranger
pay the fine to that servant, for his more comfortable
maintenance, if he stays in his service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>A man of honour and generosity considers it would be
miserable to himself to have no will but that of another,
though it were of the best person breathing, and for that
reason goes on as fast as he is able to put his servants
into independent livelihoods. The greatest part of Sir {<a href="#p83">5</a>}
Roger's estate is tenanted by persons who have served
himself or his ancestors. It was to me extremely pleasant
to observe the visitants from several parts to welcome
his arrival into the country; and all the difference that I
could take notice of between the late<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> servants who came {10}
to see him and those who stayed in the family, was that
these latter were looked upon as finer gentlemen and
better courtiers.</p>

<p>This manumission and placing them in a way of livelihood
I look upon as only what is due to a good servant, {15}
which encouragement will make his successor be as diligent,
as humble, and as ready as he was. There is something
wonderful in the narrowness of those minds which
can be pleased, and be barren of bounty to those who
please them. {20}</p>

<p>One might, on this occasion, recount the sense that
great persons in all ages have had of the merit of their
dependants, and the heroic services which men have done
their masters in the extremity of their fortunes, and shown
to their undone patrons that fortune was all the difference {25}
between them; but as I design this my speculation only
as a gentle admonition to thankless masters, I shall not
go out of the occurrences of common life, but assert it, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
a general observation, that I never saw, but in Sir Roger's
family and one or two more, good servants treated as
they ought to be. Sir Roger's kindness extends to their
children's children, and this very morning he sent his
coachman's grandson to prentice. I shall conclude {5}
this paper with an account of a picture in his gallery,
where there are many which will deserve my future observation.</p>

<p>At the very upper end of this handsome structure I saw
the portraiture of two young men standing in a river,&mdash;the {10}
one naked, the other in a livery. The person supported
seemed half dead, but still so much alive as to
show in his face exquisite joy and love towards the other.
I thought the fainting figure resembled my friend Sir
Roger; and, looking at the butler, who stood by me, for {15}
an account of it, he informed me that the person in the
livery was a servant of Sir Roger's, who stood on the shore
while his master was swimming, and observing him taken
with some sudden illness, and sink under water, jumped
in and saved him.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He told me Sir Roger took off the {20}
dress he was in as soon as he came home, and by a great
bounty at that time, followed by his favour ever since, had
made him master of that pretty seat which we saw at a
distance as we came to this house. I remembered indeed
Sir Roger said there lived a very worthy gentleman, to {25}
whom he was highly obliged, without mentioning anything
further. Upon my looking a little dissatisfied at some
part of the picture, my attendant informed me that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
against Sir Roger's will, and at the earnest request of the
gentleman himself, that he was drawn in the habit in
which he had saved his master.</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Phaed.</span></span></div>

<p>As I was yesterday morning walking with Sir Roger
before his house, a country fellow brought him a huge {<a href="#p85">5</a>}
fish, which, he told him, Mr. William Wimble had caught
that very morning; and that he presented it with his service
to him, and intended to come and dine with him.
At the same time he delivered a letter, which my friend
read to me as soon as the messenger left him. {10}</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
"Sir Roger,<br />
</p>

<p>"I desire you to accept of a jack,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> which is the best I
have caught this season. I intend to come and stay with
you a week, and see how the perch bite in the Black
River. I observed with some concern, the last time I {15}
saw you upon the bowling green, that your whip wanted
a lash to it; I will bring half a dozen with me that I
twisted last week, which I hope will serve you all the time
you are in the country. I have not been out of the saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
for six days last past, having been at Eton with Sir John's
eldest son. He takes to his learning hugely.</p>

<p class="pm2">
"I am, sir, your humble servant,</p>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Will Wimble.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>This extraordinary letter, and message that accompanied {<a href="#p86">5</a>}
it, made me very curious to know the character
and quality<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of the gentleman who sent them, which I
found to be as follows. Will Wimble is younger brother
to a baronet, and descended of the ancient family of the
Wimbles. He is now between forty and fifty, but, being {10}
bred to no business and born to no estate, he generally
lives with his elder brother as superintendent of his game.
He hunts<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> a pack of dogs better than any man in the
country, and is very famous for finding out a hare. He
is extremely well versed in all the little handicrafts of an {15}
idle man; he makes a may-fly<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to a miracle, and furnishes
the whole country with angle-rods. As he is a good-natured,
officious fellow, and very much esteemed upon
account of his family, he is a welcome guest at every
house, and keeps up a good correspondence among all {20}
the gentlemen about him. He carries a tulip-root in his
pocket from one to another, or exchanges a puppy between
a couple of friends that live perhaps in the opposite
sides of the county. Will is a particular favourite of all the
young heirs, whom he frequently obliges with a net that {25}
he has weaved, or a setting-dog that he has made<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
He now and then presents a pair of garters of his own
knitting to their mothers or sisters, and raises a great
deal of mirth among them by inquiring, as often as he
meets them, how they wear. These gentleman-like manufactures
and obliging little humours make Will the darling {5}
of the country.</p>

<p>Sir Roger was proceeding in the character of him,
when he saw him make up to us with two or three hazel
twigs in his hand that he had cut in Sir Roger's woods, as
he came through them, in his way to the house. I was {10}
very much pleased to observe on one side the hearty and
sincere welcome with which Sir Roger received him, and
on the other, the secret joy which his guest discovered at
sight of the good old knight. After the first salutes were
over, Will desired Sir Roger to lend him one of his servants {15}
to carry a set of shuttlecocks he had with him in
a little box to a lady that lived about a mile off, to whom
it seems he had promised such a present for above this
half year. Sir Roger's back was no sooner turned but
honest Will began to tell me of a large cock-pheasant {20}
that he had sprung in one of the neighbouring woods, with
two or three other adventures of the same nature. Odd
and uncommon characters are the game that I look for
and most delight in; for which reason I was as much
pleased with the novelty of the person that talked to me as {25}
he could be for his life with the springing of a pheasant,
and therefore listened to him with more than ordinary
attention.</p>

<p>In the midst of his discourse the bell rung to dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
where the gentleman I have been speaking of had the
pleasure of seeing the huge jack he had caught, served
up for the first dish in a most sumptuous manner. Upon
our sitting down to it, he gave us a long account how he
had hooked it, played with it, foiled it, and at length {5}
drew it out upon the bank, with several other particulars
that lasted all the first course. A dish of wild fowl that
came afterwards furnished conversation for the rest of the
dinner, which concluded with a late invention of Will's
for improving the quail-pipe.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> {10}</p>

<p>Upon withdrawing into my room after dinner, I was
secretly touched with compassion towards the honest
gentleman that had dined with us, and could not but consider,
with a great deal of concern, how so good an heart
and such busy hands were wholly employed in trifles; {15}
that so much humanity should be so little beneficial to
others, and so much industry so little advantageous to himself.
The same temper of mind and application to affairs
might have recommended him to the public esteem, and
have raised his fortune in another station of life. What {20}
good to his country or himself might not a trader or
merchant have done with such useful though ordinary
qualifications?</p>

<p>Will Wimble's is the case of many a younger brother
of a great family, who had rather see their children starve {25}
like gentlemen than thrive in a trade or profession that is
beneath their quality. This humour fills several parts of
Europe with pride and beggary. It is the happiness of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
trading nation, like ours, that the younger sons, though
uncapable of any liberal art or profession, may be placed
in such a way of life as may perhaps enable them to vie
with the best of their family. Accordingly, we find several
citizens that were launched into the world with narrow {<a href="#p89">5</a>}
fortunes, rising by an honest industry to greater estates
than those of their elder brothers. It is not improbable
but Will was formerly tried at divinity, law, or physic;
and that finding his genius did not lie that way, his parents
gave him up at length to his own inventions. But {10}
certainly, however improper<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> he might have been for
studies of a higher nature, he was perfectly well turned
for the occupations of trade and commerce. As I think
this is a point which cannot be too much inculcated, I
shall desire my reader to compare what I have here written, {15}
with what I have said in my twenty-first speculation.</p>

<p>I was this morning walking in the gallery, when Sir
Roger entered at the end opposite to me, and, advancing
towards me, said he was glad to meet me among his rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>tions,
the de Coverleys, and hoped I liked the conversation
of so much good company, who were as silent as myself.
I knew he alluded to the pictures; and, as he is a gentleman
who does not a little value himself upon his ancient
descent, I expected he would give me some account of {<a href="#p90">5</a>}
them. We were now arrived at the upper end of the gallery,
when the knight faced towards one of the pictures,
and, as we stood before it, he entered into the matter,
after his blunt way of saying things as they occur to his
imagination, without regular introduction or care to preserve {10}
the appearance of chain of thought.</p>

<p>"It is," said he, "worth while to consider the force of
dress, and how the persons of one age differ from those
of another merely by that only. One may observe, also,
that the general fashion of one age has been followed by {15}
one particular set of people in another, and by them preserved
from one generation to another. Thus, the vast
jetting coat and small bonnet, which was the habit<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> in
Harry the Seventh's time, is kept on in the yeomen of the
guard; not without a good and politic view, because they {20}
look a foot taller, and a foot and an half broader; besides
that the cap leaves the face expanded, and consequently
more terrible, and fitter to stand at the entrance of
palaces.</p>

<p>"This predecessor of ours, you see, is dressed after {25}
this manner, and his cheeks would be no larger than
mine, were he in a hat as I am. He was the last man
that won a prize in the Tilt-yard, which is now a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
street before Whitehall. You see the broken lance that
lies there by his right foot. He shivered that lance of his
adversary all to pieces; and, bearing himself&mdash;look you,
sir&mdash;in this manner, at the same time he came within
the target of the gentleman who rode against him, and {<a href="#p91">5</a>}
taking him with incredible force before him on the pommel
of his saddle, he in that manner rid the tournament
over, with an air that showed he did it rather to perform
the rule<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of the lists than expose his enemy. However, it
appeared he knew how to make use of a victory; and, {10}
with a gentle trot, he marched up to a gallery where their
mistress sat,&mdash;for they were rivals,&mdash;and let him down
with laudable courtesy and pardonable insolence. I don't
know but it might be exactly where the coffee-house is
now. {15}</p>

<p>"You are to know this my ancestor was not only of a
military genius, but fit also for the arts of peace; for he
played on the bass viol as well as any gentleman at
court. You see where his viol hangs by his basket-hilt
sword. The action at the Tilt-yard you may be sure won {20}
the fair lady, who was a maid of honour, and the greatest
beauty of her time. Here she stands, the next picture.
You see, sir, my great-great-great-grandmother has on the
new-fashioned petticoat, except that the modern is gathered
at the waist: my grandmother appears as if she {25}
stood in a large drum, whereas the ladies now walk as
if they were in a go-cart. For all this lady was bred at
court, she became an excellent country wife; she brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
ten children; and, when I show you the library, you shall
see, in her own hand, allowing for the difference of the
language, the best receipt now in England both for an
hasty-pudding and a white-pot.</p>

<p>"If you please to fall back a little,&mdash;because 'tis necessary {<a href="#p92">5</a>}
to look at the three next pictures at one view,&mdash;these
are three sisters. She on the right hand, who is so very
beautiful, died a maid; the next to her, still handsomer,
had the same fate, against her will; this homely thing in
the middle had both their portions added to her own, and {10}
was stolen by a neighbouring gentleman, a man of stratagem
and resolution, for he poisoned three mastiffs to come
at her, and knocked down two deer-stealers in carrying
her off. Misfortunes happen in all families. The theft
of this romp and so much money was no great matter to {15}
our estate. But the next heir that possessed it<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> was this
soft gentleman, whom you see there; observe the small
buttons, the little boots, the laces, the slashes about his
clothes, and, above all, the posture he is drawn in,&mdash;which
to be sure was his own choosing. You see he sits {20}
with one hand on a desk, writing and looking as it were
another way, like an easy writer or a sonneteer. He was
one of those that had too much wit to know how to live in
the world: he was a man of no justice, but great good
manners; he ruined everybody that had anything to do {25}
with him, but never said a rude thing in his life; the
most indolent person in the world, he would sign a deed
that passed away half his estate, with his gloves on, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
would not put on his hat before a lady if it were to save
his country. He is said to be the first that made love
by squeezing the hand. He left the estate with ten thousand
pounds' debt upon it; but, however, by all hands I
have been informed that he was every way the finest {<a href="#p93">5</a>}
gentleman in the world. That debt lay heavy on our
house for one generation; but it was retrieved by a gift
from that honest man you see there, a citizen of our
name, but nothing at all akin to us. I know Sir Andrew
Freeport has said behind my back that this man was {10}
descended from one of the ten children of the maid of
honour I showed you above; but it was never made out.
We winked at the thing, indeed, because money was
wanting at that time."</p>

<p>Here I saw my friend a little embarrassed, and turned {15}
my face to the next portraiture.</p>

<p>Sir Roger went on with his account of the gallery in
the following manner: "This man"&mdash;pointing to him I
looked at&mdash;"I take to be the honour of our house, Sir
Humphrey de Coverley. He was, in his dealings, as {20}
punctual as a tradesman and as generous as a gentleman.
He would have thought himself as much undone by breaking
his word as if it were to be followed by bankruptcy.
He served his country as knight of this shire<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> to his dying
day. He found it no easy matter to maintain an integrity {25}
in his words and actions, even in things that regarded the
offices which were incumbent upon him in the care of his
own affairs and relations of life, and therefore dreaded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
though he had great talents, to go into employments of
state, where he must be exposed to the snares of ambition.
Innocence of life and great ability were the distinguishing
parts of his character; the latter, he had often
observed, had led to the destruction of the former, and {<a href="#p94">5</a>}
used frequently to lament that <em>great</em> and <em>good</em> had not
the same signification. He was an excellent husbandman,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
but had resolved not to exceed such a degree of
wealth; all above it he bestowed in secret bounties many
years after the sum he aimed at for his own use was attained. {10}
Yet he did not slacken his industry, but to a
decent old age spent the life and fortune which was
superfluous to himself, in the service of his friends and
neighbours."</p>

<p>Here we were called to dinner; and Sir Roger ended {15}
the discourse of this gentleman by telling me, as we followed
the servant, that this his ancestor was a brave man,
and narrowly escaped being killed in the Civil Wars;
"for," said he, "he was sent out of the field upon a
private message the day before the battle of Worcester." {20}</p>

<p>The whim of narrowly escaping by having been within
a day of danger, with other matters above mentioned,
mixed with good sense, left me at a loss whether I was
more delighted with my friend's wisdom or simplicity.  {25}</p>

<h2><a name="X_THE_COVERLEY_GHOST" id="X_THE_COVERLEY_GHOST">X. THE COVERLEY GHOST</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 110. Friday, July 6, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>At a little distance from Sir Roger's house, among the
ruins of an old abbey, there is a long walk of aged elms,
which are shot up so very high that, when one passes
under them, the rooks and crows that rest upon the tops
of them seem to be cawing in another region. I am very {<a href="#p95">5</a>}
much delighted with this sort of noise, which I consider
as a kind of natural prayer to that Being who supplies
the wants of His whole creation, and who, in the beautiful
language of the Psalms, feedeth the young ravens that
call upon Him. I like this retirement the better, because {10}
of an ill report it lies under of being haunted; for which
reason, as I have been told in the family, no living creature
ever walks in it besides the chaplain. My good
friend the butler desired me, with a very grave face, not
to venture myself in it after sunset, for that one of the {15}
footmen had been almost frighted out of his wits by a
spirit that appeared to him in the shape of a black horse
without an head; to which he added, that about a month
ago one of the maids coming home late that way, with a
pail of milk upon her head, heard such a rustling among {20}
the bushes that she let it fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>I was taking a walk in this place last night between the
hours of nine and ten, and could not but fancy it one
of the most proper scenes in the world for a ghost to
appear in. The ruins of the abbey are scattered up and
down on every side, and half covered with ivy and elder {<a href="#p96">5</a>}
bushes, the harbours of several solitary birds which seldom
make their appearance till the dusk of the evening. The
place was formerly a church-yard, and has still several
marks in it of graves and burying-places. There is such
an echo among the old ruins and vaults that, if you stamp {10}
but a little louder than ordinary, you hear the sound repeated.
At the same time the walk of elms, with the
croaking of the ravens which from time to time are heard
from the tops of them, looks exceeding solemn and venerable.
These objects naturally raise seriousness and {15}
attention; and when night heightens the awfulness of the
place, and pours out her supernumerary horrors upon
everything in it, I do not at all wonder that weak minds
fill it with spectres and apparitions.</p>

<p>Mr. Locke, in his chapter of the Association of Ideas, {20}
has very curious remarks to show how, by the prejudice
of education, one idea often introduces into the mind a
whole set that bear no resemblance to one another in the
nature of things.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Among several examples of this kind,
he produces the following instance: "The ideas of goblins {25}
and sprites have really no more to do with darkness
than light; yet, let but a foolish maid inculcate these
often on the mind of a child, and raise them there to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>gether,
possibly he shall never be able to separate them
again so long as he lives, but darkness shall ever afterwards
bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall
be so joined that he can no more bear the one than the
other." {5}</p>

<p>As I was walking in this solitude, where the dusk of
the evening conspired with so many other occasions of
terror, I observed a cow grazing not far from me, which
an imagination that is apt to startle might easily have
construed into a black horse without an head; and I dare {10}
say the poor footman lost his wits upon some such trivial
occasion.</p>

<p>My friend Sir Roger has often told me, with a great
deal of mirth, that at his first coming to his estate, he
found three parts of his house altogether useless: that {15}
the best room in it had the reputation of being haunted,
and by that means was locked up; that noises had been
heard in his long gallery, so that he could not get a servant
to enter it after eight o'clock at night; that the door
of one of his chambers was nailed up, because there went {20}
a story in the family that a butler had formerly hanged
himself in it; and that his mother, who lived to a great
age, had shut up half the rooms in the house, in which
either her husband, a son, or daughter had died. The
knight, seeing his habitation reduced to so small a {25}
compass and himself in a manner shut out of his own
house, upon the death of his mother ordered all the apartments
to be flung open and exorcised by his chaplain,
who lay in every room one after another, and by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
means dissipated the fears which had so long reigned in
the family.</p>

<p>I should not have been thus particular upon these ridiculous
horrors, did not I find them so very much prevail in
all parts of the country. At the same time, I think a person {<a href="#p98">5</a>}
who is thus terrified with the imagination of ghosts
and spectres much more reasonable than one who, contrary
to the reports of all historians, sacred and profane,
ancient and modern, and to the traditions of all nations,
thinks the appearance of spirits fabulous and groundless. {10}
Could not I give myself up to this general testimony of
mankind, I should to the relations of particular persons
who are now living, and whom I cannot distrust in other
matters of fact. I might here add, that not only the historians,
to whom we may join the poets, but likewise {15}
the philosophers of antiquity have favoured this opinion.
Lucretius himself, though by the course of his philosophy
he was obliged to maintain that the soul did not exist
separate from the body, makes no doubt of the reality of
apparitions, and that men have often appeared after their {20}
death. This I think very remarkable: he was so pressed
with the matter of fact which he could not have the confidence
to deny, that he was forced to account for it by
one of the most absurd unphilosophical notions that was
ever started. He tells us that the surfaces of all bodies {25}
are perpetually flying off from their respective bodies one
after another; and that these surfaces or thin cases that
included each other, whilst they were joined in the body,
like the coats of an onion, are sometimes seen entire when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
they are separated from it; by which means we often
behold the shapes and shadows of persons who are either
dead or absent.</p>

<p>I shall dismiss this paper with a story out of Josephus,
not so much for the sake of the story itself as for the {<a href="#p99">5</a>}
moral reflections with which the author concludes it, and
which I shall here set down in his own words:</p>

<p>"Glaphyra, the daughter of King Archelaus, after the
death of her two first husbands,&mdash;being married to a
third, who was brother to her first husband, and so passionately {10}
in love with her that he turned off his former
wife to make room for this marriage,&mdash;had a very odd
kind of dream. She fancied that she saw her first husband
coming towards her, and that she embraced him with
great tenderness; when in the midst of the pleasure which {15}
she expressed at the sight of him, he reproached her after
the following manner:</p>

<p>"'Glaphyra,' says he, 'thou hast made good the old
saying that women are not to be trusted. Was not I the
husband of thy virginity? Have I not children by thee? {20}
How couldst thou forget our loves so far as to enter
into a second marriage, and after that into a third?...
However, for the sake of our past loves I shall free
thee from thy present reproach, and make thee mine
for ever.' {25}</p>

<p>"Glaphyra told this dream to several women of her
acquaintance, and died soon after.</p>

<p>"I thought this story might not be impertinent in this
place wherein I speak of those kings. Besides that, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
example deserves to be taken notice of, as it contains a
most certain proof of the immortality of the soul, and of
divine providence. If any man thinks these facts incredible,
let him enjoy his own opinion to himself, but let him
not endeavour to disturb the belief of others, who by {5}
instances of this nature are excited to the study of
virtue." </p>

<p class="center">[No. 112. Monday, July 9, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<p>I am always very well pleased with a country Sunday,
and think, if keeping holy the seventh day were only a
human institution, it would be the best method that could {10}
have been thought of for the polishing and civilizing of
mankind. It is certain the country people would soon
degenerate into a kind of savages and barbarians were
there not such frequent returns of a stated time, in which
the whole village meet together with their best faces, and {15}
in their cleanliest habits, to converse with one another
upon indifferent<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> subjects, hear their duties explained to
them, and join together in adoration of the Supreme
Being. Sunday clears away the rust of the whole week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
not only as it refreshes in their minds the notions
of religion, but as it puts both the sexes upon appearing
in their most agreeable forms, and exerting all such
qualities as are apt to give them a figure in the eye of
the village. A country fellow distinguishes himself as {<a href="#p101">5</a>}
much in the church-yard as a citizen does upon the
Change,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the whole parish politics being generally discussed
at that place, either after sermon or before the
bell rings.</p>

<p>My friend Sir Roger, being a good churchman, has {10}
beautified the inside of his church with several texts of
his own choosing; he has likewise given a handsome
pulpit cloth, and railed in the communion table at his
own expense. He has often told me that, at his coming
to his estate, he found his parishioners very irregular; {15}
and that in order to make them kneel and join in the
responses, he gave every one of them a hassock and a
Common Prayer Book, and at the same time employed
an itinerant singing-master, who goes about the country
for that purpose, to instruct them rightly in the tunes of {20}
the Psalms; upon which they now very much value themselves,
and indeed outdo most of the country churches
that I have ever heard.</p>

<p>As Sir Roger is landlord to the whole congregation, he
keeps them in very good order, and will suffer nobody to {25}
sleep in it besides himself; for, if by chance he has been
surprised into a short nap at sermon, upon recovering out
of it he stands up and looks about him, and, if he sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
anybody else nodding, either wakes them himself, or
sends his servant to them. Several other of the old
knight's particularities<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> break out upon these occasions:
sometimes he will be lengthening out a verse in the singing {5}
Psalms half a minute after the rest of the congregation
have done with it; sometimes, when he is pleased
with the matter of his devotion, he pronounces "Amen"
three or four times to the same prayer; and sometimes
stands up when everybody else is upon their<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> knees, to
count the congregation, or see if any of his tenants are {10}
missing.</p>

<p>I was yesterday very much surprised to hear my old
friend, in the midst of the service, calling out to one
John Matthews to mind what he was about, and not disturb
the congregation. This John Matthews, it seems, is {15}
remarkable for being an idle fellow, and at that time was
kicking his heels for his diversion. This authority of the
knight, though exerted in that odd manner which accompanies
him in all circumstances of life, has a very good
effect upon the parish, who are not polite enough to see {20}
anything ridiculous in his behaviour; besides that the general
good sense and worthiness of his character makes his
friends observe these little singularities as foils that rather
set off than blemish his good qualities.</p>

<p>As soon as the sermon is finished, nobody presumes to {25}
stir till Sir Roger is gone out of the church. The knight
walks down from his seat in the chancel between a double
row of his tenants, that stand bowing to him on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
side, and every now and then inquires how such an one's
wife, or mother, or son, or father do, whom he does not
see at church,&mdash;which is understood as a secret reprimand
to the person that is absent.</p>

<p>The chaplain has often told me that, upon a catechizing {<a href="#p103">5</a>}
day, when Sir Roger had been pleased with a boy that
answers well, he has ordered a Bible to be given him
next day for his encouragement, and sometimes accompanies
it with a flitch of bacon to his mother. Sir Roger
has likewise added five pounds a year to the clerk's {10}
place; and, that he may encourage the young fellows to
make themselves perfect in the church service, has promised,
upon the death of the present incumbent, who is
very old, to bestow it according to merit.</p>

<p>The fair understanding between Sir Roger and his {15}
chaplain and their mutual concurrence in doing good, is
the more remarkable because the very next village is
famous for the differences and contentions that rise between
the parson and the squire, who live in a perpetual
state of war. The parson is always preaching at the {20}
squire, and the squire, to be revenged on the parson,
never comes to church. The squire has made all his
tenants atheists and tithe stealers; while the parson instructs
them every Sunday in the dignity of his order,
and insinuates to them in almost every sermon that he is {25}
a better man than his patron. In short, matters are come
to such an extremity that the squire has not said his
prayers either in public or private this half year; and
that the parson threatens him, if he does not mend his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
manners, to pray for him in the face of the whole
congregation.</p>

<p>Feuds of this nature, though too frequent in the country,
are very fatal to the ordinary people, who are so used
to be dazzled with riches that they pay as much deference {5}
to the understanding of a man of an estate as of a man
of learning; and are very hardly brought to regard any
truth, how important soever it may be, that is preached
to them, when they know there are several men of five
hundred a year<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> who do not believe it. {10}

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>In my first description of the company in which I pass
most of my time, it may be remembered that I mentioned
a great affliction which my friend Sir Roger had met with
in his youth,&mdash;which was no less than a disappointment
in love. It happened this evening that we fell into a very {15}
pleasing walk at a distance from his house. As soon as
we came into it, "It is," quoth the good old man, looking
round him with a smile, "very hard that any part of my
land should be settled upon one who has used me so ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
as the perverse widow did; and yet I am sure I could
not see a sprig of any bough of this whole walk of trees
but I should reflect upon her and her severity. She has
certainly the finest hand of any woman in the world.
You are to know this was the place wherein I used to {<a href="#p105">5</a>}
muse upon her; and by that custom I can never come
into it but the same tender sentiments revive in my mind,
as if I had actually walked with that beautiful creature
under these shades. I have been fool enough to carve
her name on the bark of several of these trees; so unhappy {10}
is the condition of men in love to attempt the removing
of their passion by the methods which serve only
to imprint it deeper. She has certainly the finest hand
of any woman in the world."</p>

<p>Here followed a profound silence; and I was not displeased {15}
to observe my friend falling so naturally into a
discourse which I had ever before taken notice he industriously
avoided. After a very long pause, he entered
upon an account of this great circumstance in his life,
with an air which I thought raised my idea of him above {20}
what I had ever had before; and gave me the picture of
that cheerful mind of his before it received that stroke
which has ever since affected his words and actions. But
he went on as follows:</p>

<p>"I came to my estate in my twenty-second year, and {25}
resolved to follow the steps of the most worthy of my
ancestors who have inhabited this spot of earth before
me, in all the methods of hospitality and good neighbourhood,
for the sake of my fame, and in country sports and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
recreations, for the sake of my health. In my twenty-third
year I was obliged to serve as sheriff of the county;
and in my servants, officers, and whole equipage, indulged
the pleasure of a young man, who did not think ill of his
own person, in taking that public occasion of showing my {5}
figure and behaviour to advantage. You may easily imagine
to yourself what appearance I made, who am pretty tall,
rid well, and was very well dressed, at the head of a whole
county, with music before me, a feather in my hat, and
my horse well bitted. I can assure you I was not a little {10}
pleased with the kind looks and glances I had from all
the balconies and windows, as I rode to the hall where
the assizes were held. But when I came there, a beautiful
creature in a widow's habit sat in court, to hear the
event<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of a cause concerning her dower. This commanding {15}
creature (who was born for destruction of all who behold
her) put on such a resignation in her countenance,
and bore the whispers of all around the court with such
a pretty uneasiness, I warrant you, and then recovered
herself from one eye to another, till she was perfectly confused {20}
by meeting something so wistful in all she encountered,
that at last, with a murrain to her,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> she cast her
bewitching eye upon me. I no sooner met it but I bowed
like a great surprised booby; and, knowing her cause to
be the first which came on, I cried, like a captivated calf {25}
as I was, 'Make way for the defendant's witnesses!' This
sudden partiality made all the county immediately see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
sheriff also was become a slave to the fine widow. During
the time her cause was upon trial, she behaved herself,
I warrant you, with such a deep attention to her
business, took opportunities to have little billets handed
to her counsel, then would be in such a pretty confusion, {5}
occasioned, you must know, by acting before so much
company, that not only I but the whole court was prejudiced
in her favour; and all that the next heir to her husband
had to urge was thought so groundless and frivolous
that, when it came to her counsel to reply, there was not {10}
half so much said as every one besides in the court
thought he could have urged to her advantage. You
must understand, sir, this perverse woman is one of those
unaccountable creatures that secretly rejoice in the admiration
of men, but indulge themselves in no further {15}
consequences. Hence it is that she has ever had a train
of admirers, and she removes from her slaves in town to
those in the country according to the seasons of the year.
She is a reading lady, and far gone in the pleasures of
friendship; she is always accompanied by a confidante, {20}
who is witness to her daily protestations against our sex,
and consequently a bar to her first steps towards love,
upon the strength of her own maxims and declarations.</p>

<p>"However, I must needs say this accomplished mistress
of mine has distinguished me above the rest, and {25}
has been known to declare Sir Roger de Coverley was the
tamest and most human of all the brutes in the country.
I was told she said so by one who thought he rallied me;
but, upon the strength of this slender encouragement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
being thought least detestable, I made new liveries, new-paired
my coach-horses, sent them all to town to be bitted
and taught to throw their legs well and move altogether,
before I pretended to cross the country and wait upon
her. As soon as I thought my retinue suitable to the {<a href="#p108">5</a>}
character of my fortune and youth, I set out from hence
to make my addresses. The particular skill of this lady
has ever been to inflame your wishes and yet command
respect. To make her mistress of this art, she has a
greater share of knowledge, wit, and good sense than is {10}
usual even among men of merit. Then she is beautiful
beyond the race of women. If you won't let her go on
with a certain artifice with her eyes, and the skill of
beauty, she will arm herself with her real charms, and
strike you with admiration instead of desire. It is certain {15}
that, if you were to behold the whole woman, there
is that dignity in her aspect, that composure in her
motion, that complacency in her manner, that if her form
makes you hope, her merit makes you fear. But then
again, she is such a desperate scholar that no country {20}
gentleman can approach her without being a jest. As I
was going to tell you, when I came to her house I was
admitted to her presence with great civility; at the same
time she placed herself to be first seen by me in such an
attitude, as I think you call the posture of a picture, that {25}
she discovered new charms, and I at last came towards
her with such an awe as made me speechless. This she
no sooner observed but she made her advantage of it,
and began a discourse to me concerning love and honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
as they both are followed by pretenders, and the real
votaries to them. When she had discussed these points
in a discourse which I verily believe was as learned as
the best philosopher in Europe could possibly make, she
asked me whether she was so happy as to fall in with my {<a href="#p109">5</a>}
sentiments on these important particulars. Her confidante
sat by her, and upon my being in the last confusion
and silence, this malicious aid of hers, turning to her,
says, 'I am very glad to observe Sir Roger pauses upon
this subject, and seems resolved to deliver all his sentiments {10}
upon the matter when he pleases to speak.' They
both kept their countenances, and after I had sat half an
hour meditating how to behave before such profound
casuists, I rose up and took my leave. Chance has since
that time thrown me very often in her way, and she as {15}
often has directed a discourse to me which I do not
understand. This barbarity has kept me ever at a distance
from the most beautiful object my eyes ever beheld.
It is thus also she deals with all mankind, and you must
make love to her, as you would conquer the sphinx, by {20}
posing<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> her. But were she like other women, and that
there were any talking to her, how constant must the
pleasure of that man be who could converse with a creature&mdash;But,
after all, you may be sure her heart is fixed
on some one or other; and yet I have been credibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> {25}
informed&mdash;but who can believe half that is said? After
she had done speaking to me, she put her hand to her
bosom and adjusted her tucker. Then she cast her eyes
a little down, upon my beholding her too earnestly. They
say she sings excellently; her voice in her ordinary speech {<a href="#p110">5</a>}
has something in it inexpressibly sweet. You must know
I dined with her at a public table the day after I first saw
her, and she helped me to some tansy in the eye of all
the gentlemen in the country: she has certainly the finest
hand of any woman in the world. I can assure you, sir, {10}
were you to behold her, you would be in the same condition;
for, as her speech is music, her form is angelic.
But I find I grow irregular while I am talking of her;
but indeed it would be stupidity to be unconcerned at
such perfection. Oh, the excellent creature! she is as {15}
inimitable to all women as she is inaccessible to all men."</p>

<p>I found my friend begin to rave, and insensibly led
him towards the house, that we might be joined by some
other company; and am convinced that the widow is
the secret cause of all that inconsistency which appears {20}
in some parts of my friend's discourse. Though he has
so much command of himself as not directly to mention
her, yet, according to that of Martial, which one knows
not how to render in English, "<i lang="la">Dum tacet hanc loquitur</i>."
I shall end this paper with that whole epigram, which {25}
represents with much humor my honest friend's condition.</p>

<p>Economy in our affairs has the same effect upon our {10}
fortunes which good breeding has upon our conversations.
There is a pretending behaviour in both cases, which,
instead of making men esteemed, renders them both
miserable and contemptible. We had yesterday at Sir
Roger's, a set of country gentlemen who dined with him; {15}
and after dinner, the glass was taken by those who pleased
pretty plentifully. Among others, I observed a person of
a tolerable good aspect, who seemed to be more greedy
of liquor than any of the company; and yet, methought,
he did not taste it with delight. As he grew warm, he {20}
was suspicious of everything that was said; and as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
advanced towards being fuddled, his humour grew worse.
At the same time, his bitterness seemed to be rather an
inward dissatisfaction in his own mind than any dislike
he had taken to the company. Upon hearing his name,
I knew him to be a gentleman of a considerable fortune {5}
in this county, but greatly in debt. What gives the unhappy
man this peevishness of spirit is, that his estate is
dipped,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and is eating out with usury;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and yet he has
not the heart to sell any part of it. His proud stomach,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
at the cost of restless nights, constant inquietudes, danger {10}
of affronts, and a thousand nameless inconveniences, preserves
this canker in his fortune, rather than it shall be
said he is a man of fewer hundreds a year than he has
been commonly reputed. Thus he endures the torment
of poverty, to avoid the name of being less rich. If you {15}
go to his house you see great plenty, but served in a
manner that shows it is all unnatural, and that the master's
mind is not at home. There is a certain waste and
carelessness in the air of everything, and the whole appears
but a covered indigence, a magnificent poverty. {20}
That neatness and cheerfulness which attends the table
of him who lives within compass, is wanting, and exchanged
for a libertine way of service in all about him.</p>

<p>This gentleman's conduct, though a very common way
of management, is as ridiculous as that officer's would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> {25}
who had but few men under his command, and should
take the charge of an extent of country rather than of a
small pass. To pay for, personate,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and keep in a man's
hands a greater estate than he really has, is of all others<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
the most unpardonable vanity, and must in the end reduce {<a href="#p113">5</a>}
the man who is guilty of it to dishonour. Yet, if we
look round us in any county of Great Britain, we shall
see many in this fatal error,&mdash;if that may be called by
so soft a name which proceeds from a false shame of
appearing what they really are,&mdash;when the contrary behavior {10}
would in a short time advance them to the condition
which they pretend to.</p>

<p>Laertes has fifteen hundred pounds a year, which is
mortgaged for six thousand pounds; but it is impossible
to convince him that if he sold as much as would pay off {15}
that debt he would save four shillings in the pound, which
he gives for the vanity of being the reputed master of it.
Yet, if Laertes did this, he would perhaps be easier in his
own fortune; but then, Irus, a fellow of yesterday, who
has but twelve hundred a year, would be his equal. {20}
Rather than this shall be, Laertes goes on to bring well-born
beggars into the world, and every twelvemonth
charges his estate with at least one year's rent more by
the birth of a child.</p>

<p>Laertes and Irus are neighbours, whose way of living {25}
are<a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> an abomination to each other. Irus is moved by the
fear of poverty, and Laertes by the shame of it. Though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
motive of action is of so near affinity in both, and may be
resolved into this, "That to each of them poverty is the
greatest of all evils," yet are their manners very widely
different. Shame of poverty makes Laertes launch into
unnecessary equipage, vain expense, and lavish entertainments; {<a href="#p114">5</a>}
fear of poverty makes Irus allow himself only
plain necessaries, appear without a servant, sell his own
corn, attend his labourers, and be himself a labourer.
Shame of poverty makes Laertes go every day a step
nearer to it, and fear of poverty stirs up Irus to make {10}
every day some further progress from it.</p>

<p>These different motives produce the excesses which
men are guilty of in the negligence of and provision for
themselves. Usury, stock-jobbing, extortion, and oppression
have their seed in the dread of want; and vanity, {15}
riot, and prodigality, from the shame of it: but both these
excesses are infinitely below the pursuit of a reasonable
creature. After we have taken care to command so much
as is necessary for maintaining ourselves in the order of
men suitable to our character, the care of superfluities is {20}
a vice no less extravagant<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> than the neglect of necessaries
would have been before.</p>

<p>Certain it is that they are both out of<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> nature when she
is followed with reason and good sense. It is from this
reflection that I always read Mr. Cowley with the greatest {25}
pleasure. His magnanimity is as much above that of
other considerable men, as his understanding; and it is
a true distinguishing spirit in the elegant author who pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>lished
his works, to dwell so much upon the temper of
his mind and the moderation of his desires. By this
means he has rendered his friend as amiable as famous.
That state of life which bears the face of poverty with
Mr. Cowley's "great vulgar," is admirably described,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and {<a href="#p115">5</a>}
it is no small satisfaction to those of the same turn of desire,
that he produces the authority of the wisest men of
the best age of the world, to strengthen his opinion of the
ordinary pursuits of mankind.</p>

<p>It would, methinks, be no ill maxim of life, if, {10}
according to that ancestor of Sir Roger whom I lately
mentioned, every man would point to himself what
sum he would resolve not to exceed. He might by
this means cheat himself into a tranquillity on this
side of that expectation, or convert what he should {15}
get above it to nobler uses than his own pleasures or
necessities.</p>

<p>This temper of mind would exempt a man from an
ignorant envy of restless men above him, and a more
inexcusable contempt of happy men below him. This {20}
would be sailing by some compass, living with some
design; but to be eternally bewildered in prospects of
future gain, and putting on unnecessary armour against
improbable blows of fortune, is a mechanic being,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> which
has not good sense for its direction, but is carried on by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> {25}
a sort of acquired instinct towards things below our consideration
and unworthy our esteem.</p>

<p>It is possible that the tranquillity I now enjoy at Sir
Roger's may have created in me this way of thinking,
which is so abstracted from the common relish<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> of the {<a href="#p116">5</a>}
world; but, as I am now in a pleasing arbour, surrounded
with a beautiful landscape, I find no inclination so strong
as to continue in these mansions, so remote from the
ostentatious scenes of life; and am, at this present writing,
philosopher enough to conclude, with Mr. Cowley,&mdash; {10}</p>

<h2><a name="XIV_LABOUR_AND_EXERCISE" id="XIV_LABOUR_AND_EXERCISE">XIV. LABOUR AND EXERCISE</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 115. Thursday, July 12, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Ut sit mens sana in corpore sano.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Juv.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>Bodily labour is of two kinds: either that which a man {15}
submits to for his livelihood, or that which he undergoes
for his pleasure. The latter of them generally changes
the name of labour for that of exercise, but differs only
from ordinary labour as it rises from another motive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>A country life abounds in both these kinds of labour,
and for that reason gives a man a greater stock of health,
and consequently a more perfect enjoyment of himself,
than any other way of life. I consider the body as a system
of tubes and glands, or, to use a more rustic phrase, {<a href="#p117">5</a>}
a bundle of pipes and strainers, fitted to one another after
so wonderful a manner as to make a proper engine for
the soul to work with. This description does not only
comprehend the bowels, bones, tendons, veins, nerves,
and arteries, but every muscle and every ligature, which {10}
is a composition of fibres that are so many imperceptible
tubes or pipes, interwoven on all sides with invisible
glands or strainers.</p>

<p>This general idea of a human body, without considering
it in its niceties of anatomy, lets us see how absolutely {15}
necessary labour is for the right preservation of it. There
must be frequent motions and agitations, to mix, digest, and
separate the juices contained in it, as well as to clear and
cleanse that infinitude of pipes and strainers of which it is
composed, and to give their solid parts a more firm and {20}
lasting tone. Labour or exercise ferments the humours,
casts them into their proper channels, throws off redundancies,
and helps nature in those secret distributions
without which the body cannot subsist in its vigour, nor
the soul act with cheerfulness. {25}</p>

<p>I might here mention the effects which this has upon
all the faculties of the mind, by keeping the understanding
clear, the imagination untroubled, and refining those
spirits that are necessary for the proper exertion of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
intellectual faculties during the present laws of union between
soul and body. It is to a neglect in this particular
that we must ascribe the spleen which is so frequent in
men of studious and sedentary tempers, as well as the vapours
to which those of the other sex are so often subject. {<a href="#p118">5</a>}</p>

<p>Had not exercise been absolutely necessary for our
well-being, nature would not have made the body so
proper for it, by giving such an activity to the limbs and
such a pliancy to every part as necessarily produce those
compressions, extensions, contortions, dilatations, and all {10}
other kinds of motions that are necessary for the preservation
of such a system of tubes and glands as has been
before mentioned. And that we might not want inducements
to engage us in such an exercise of the body as is
proper for its welfare, it is so ordered that nothing valuable {15}
can be procured without it. Not to mention riches
and honour, even food and raiment are not to be come at
without the toil of the hands and sweat of the brows.
Providence furnishes materials, but expects that we should
work them up ourselves. The earth must be laboured {20}
before it gives its increase; and when it is forced into its
several products, how many hands must they pass through
before they are fit for use! Manufactures, trade, and
agriculture naturally employ more than nineteen parts
of the species in twenty; and as for those who are not {25}
obliged to labour, by the condition in which they are
born, they are more miserable than the rest of mankind
unless they indulge themselves in that voluntary labour
which goes by the name of exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>My friend Sir Roger has been an indefatigable man in
business of this kind, and has hung several parts of his
house with the trophies of his former labours. The walls
of his great hall are covered with the horns of several
kinds of deer that he has killed in the chase, which he {5}
thinks the most valuable furniture of his house, as they
afford him frequent topics of discourse, and show that
he has not been idle. At the lower end of the hall is
a large otter's skin stuffed with hay, which his mother
ordered to be hung up in that manner, and the knight {10}
looks upon it with great satisfaction, because it seems he
was but nine years old when his dog killed him.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> A little
room adjoining to the hall is a kind of arsenal filled with
guns of several sizes and inventions, with which the
knight has made great havoc in the woods, and destroyed {15}
many thousands of pheasants, partridges, and woodcocks.
His stable doors are patched with noses that belonged
to foxes of the knight's own hunting down. Sir Roger
showed me one of them, that for distinction sake has a
brass nail struck through it, which cost him about fifteen {20}
hours' riding, carried him through half a dozen counties,
killed him a brace of geldings, and lost above half his
dogs. This the knight looks upon as one of the greatest
exploits of his life. The perverse widow, whom I have
given some account of, was the death of several foxes; {25}
for Sir Roger has told me that in the course of his amours
he patched the western door of his stable. Whenever
the widow was cruel, the foxes were sure to pay for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
In proportion as his passion for the widow abated and
old age came on, he left off fox-hunting; but a hare is
not yet safe that sits within ten miles of his house.</p>

<p>There is no kind of exercise which I would so recommend
to my readers of both sexes as this of riding, as {<a href="#p120">5</a>}
there is none which so much conduces to health, and is
every way accommodated to the body, according to the
idea which I have given of it. Dr. Sydenham is very
lavish in its praises; and if the English reader will see
the mechanical effects of it described at length, he may {10}
find them in a book published not many years since,
under the title of the <cite>Medicina Gymnastica</cite>.</p>

<p>For my own part, when I am in town, for want of these
opportunities I exercise myself an hour every morning
upon a dumb-bell that is placed in a corner of my room, {15}
and pleases me the more because it does everything I
require of it in the most profound silence. My landlady
and her daughters are so well acquainted with my hours
of exercise, that they never come into my room to disturb
me whilst I am ringing. {20}</p>

<p>When I was some years younger than I am at present,
I used to employ myself in a more laborious diversion,
which I learned from a Latin treatise of exercises that
is written with great erudition. It is there called the
[Greek: skiomachia], or the fighting with a man's own shadow, and {25}
consists in the brandishing of two short sticks grasped in
each hand, and loaden with plugs of lead at either end.
This opens the chest, exercises the limbs, and gives a man
all the pleasure of boxing, without the blows. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
wish that several learned men would lay out that time
which they employ in controversies and disputes about
nothing, in this method of fighting with their own shadows.
It might conduce very much to evaporate the spleen,
which makes them uneasy<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> to the public as well as to {<a href="#p121">5</a>}
themselves.</p>

<p>To conclude, as I am a compound of soul and body, I
consider myself as obliged to a double scheme of duties,
and think I have not fulfilled the business of the day
when I do not thus employ the one in labour and exercise, {10}

</div></div></div>


<p>Those who have searched into human nature observe
that nothing so much shows the nobleness of the soul as
that its felicity consists in action. Every man has such
an active principle in him that he will find out something {15}
to employ himself upon, in whatever place or state of life
he is posted. I have heard of a gentleman who was under
close confinement in the Bastile seven years; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
which time he amused himself in scattering a few small
pins about his chamber, gathering them up again, and
placing them in different figures on the arm of a great
chair. He often told his friends afterwards, that unless
he had found out this piece of exercise, he verily believed {5}
he should have lost his senses.</p>

<p>After what has been said, I need not inform my readers
that Sir Roger, with whose character I hope they are at
present pretty well acquainted, has in his youth gone
through the whole course of those rural diversions which {10}
the country abounds in, and which seem to be extremely
well suited to that laborious industry a man may observe
here in a far greater degree than in towns and cities. I
have before hinted at some of my friend's exploits: he
has in his youthful days taken forty coveys of partridges {15}
in a season, and tired many a salmon with a line consisting
but of a single hair. The constant thanks and good wishes
of the neighbourhood always attended him on account
of his remarkable enmity towards foxes, having<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> destroyed
more of those vermin in one year than it was thought the {20}
whole country could have produced. Indeed, the knight
does not scruple to own, among his most intimate friends,
that in order to establish his reputation this way, he has
secretly sent for great numbers of them<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> out of other
counties, which he used to turn loose about the country {25}
by night, that he might the better signalize himself in their
destruction the next day. His hunting horses were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
finest and best managed in all these parts: his tenants
are still full of the praises of a gray stone-horse<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> that
unhappily staked himself<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> several years since, and was
buried with great solemnity in the orchard.</p>

<p>Sir Roger, being at present too old for fox-hunting, to {<a href="#p123">5</a>}
keep himself in action has disposed of his beagles and
got a pack of stop-hounds.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> What these want in speed
he endeavours to make amends for by the deepness of their
mouths and the variety of their notes, which are suited in
such manner to each other that the whole cry makes up {10}
a complete concert. He is so nice in this particular that
a gentleman having made him a present of a very fine
hound the other day, the knight returned it by the servant
with a great many expressions of civility, but desired him
to tell his master that the dog he had sent was indeed a {15}
most excellent bass, but that at present he only wanted
a counter tenor. Could I believe my friend had ever read
Shakespeare, I should certainly conclude he had taken
the hint from Theseus, in the <cite>Midsummer Night's
Dream</cite>: {20}</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Sir Roger is so keen at this sport that he has been out {5}
almost every day since I came down; and upon the chaplain's
offering to lend me his easy pad, I was prevailed
on yesterday morning to make one of the company. I
was extremely pleased, as we rid along, to observe the
general benevolence of all the neighbourhood towards {10}
my friend. The farmers' sons thought themselves happy
if they could open a gate for the good old knight as he
passed by; which he generally requited with a nod or a
smile, and a kind inquiry after their fathers and uncles.</p>

<p>After we had rid about a mile from home, we came {15}
upon a large heath, and the sportsmen began to beat.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
They had done so for some time, when, as I was at a little
distance from the rest of the company, I saw a hare pop
out from a small furze-brake almost under my horse's feet.
I marked the way she took, which I endeavoured to make {20}
the company sensible of by extending my arm; but to
no purpose, till Sir Roger, who knows that none of my
extraordinary motions are insignificant, rode up to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and asked me if puss was gone that way. Upon my
answering, "Yes," he immediately called in the dogs and
put them upon the scent. As they were going off, I heard
one of the country fellows muttering to his companion
that 'twas a wonder they had not lost all their sport, for {5}
want of the silent gentleman's crying "Stole away!"</p>

<p>This,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> with my aversion to leaping hedges, made me
withdraw to a rising ground, from whence I could have
the pleasure of the whole chase, without the fatigue of
keeping in with the hounds. The hare immediately threw {10}
them above a mile behind her; but I was pleased to find
that instead of running straight forwards, or, in hunter's
language, "flying the country," as I was afraid she might
have done, she wheeled about, and described a sort of
circle round the hill where I had taken my station, in {15}
such manner as gave me a very distinct view of the sport.
I could see her first pass by, and the dogs some time
afterwards unravelling the whole track she had made, and
following her through all her doubles. I was at the same
time delighted in observing that deference which the rest {20}
of the pack paid to each particular hound, according to
the character he had acquired amongst them: if they
were at fault, and an old hound of reputation opened<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> but
once, he was immediately followed by the whole cry;
while a raw dog, or one who was a noted liar, might have {25}
yelped his heart out without being taken notice of.</p>

<p>The hare now, after having squatted two or three times,
and been put up again as often, came still nearer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
place where she was at first started. The dogs pursued
her, and these were followed by the jolly knight, who
rode upon a white gelding, encompassed by his tenants
and servants, and cheering his hounds with all the gaiety
of five-and-twenty. One of the sportsmen rode up to me, {<a href="#p126">5</a>}
and told me that he was sure the chase was almost at an
end, because the old dogs, which had hitherto lain behind,
now headed the pack. The fellow was in the right. Our
hare took a large field just under us, followed by the full
cry "in view." I must confess the brightness of the {10}
weather, the cheerfulness of everything around me, the
chiding of the hounds, which was returned upon us in a
double echo from two neighbouring hills, with the hollowing
of the sportsmen, and the sounding of the horn, lifted
my spirits into a most lively pleasure, which I freely indulged {15}
because I was sure it was innocent. If I was
under any concern, it was on the account of the poor
hare, that was now quite spent, and almost within the
reach of her enemies; when the huntsman, getting forward,
threw down his pole before the dogs. They were {20}
now within eight yards of that game which they had been
pursuing for almost as many hours; yet on the signal
before mentioned, they all made a sudden stand, and
though they continued opening as much as before, durst
not once attempt to pass beyond the pole. At the same {25}
time Sir Roger rode forward, and, alighting, took up the
hare in his arms, which he soon after delivered up to one
of his servants with an order, if she could be kept alive, to
let her go in his great orchard, where it seems he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
several of these prisoners of war, who live together in a
very comfortable captivity. I was highly pleased to see
the discipline of the pack, and the good-nature of the
knight, who could not find in his heart to murder a
creature that had given him so much diversion. {<a href="#p127">5</a>}</p>

<p>As we were returning home I remembered that Monsieur
Pascal, in his most excellent discourse on the
<cite>Misery of Man</cite>, tells us that all our endeavours after
greatness proceed from nothing but a desire of being surrounded
by a multitude of persons and affairs that may {10}
hinder us from looking into ourselves, which is a view we
cannot bear. He afterwards goes on to show that our
love of sports comes from the same reason, and is particularly
severe upon hunting. "What," says he, "unless
it be to drown thought, can make men throw away so {15}
much time and pains upon a silly animal, which they
might buy cheaper in the market?" The foregoing
reflection is certainly just when a man suffers his whole
mind to be drawn into his sports, and altogether loses
himself in the woods; but does not affect those who propose {20}
a far more laudable end from this exercise,&mdash;I
mean, the preservation of health, and keeping all the
organs of the soul in a condition to execute her orders.
Had that incomparable person, whom I last quoted, been
a little more indulgent to himself in this point, the world {25}
might probably have enjoyed him much longer; whereas
through too great an application to his studies in his
youth, he contracted that ill habit of body which, after
a tedious sickness, carried him off in the fortieth year of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his age; and the whole history we have of his life till
that time, is but one continued account of the behaviour
of a noble soul struggling under innumerable pains and
distempers.</p>

<p>For my own part, I intend to hunt twice a week during {<a href="#p128">5</a>}
my stay with Sir Roger; and shall prescribe the moderate
use of this exercise to all my country friends, as the best
kind of physic for mending a bad constitution and preserving
a good one.</p>

<p>I cannot do this better than in the following lines out {10}
of Mr. Dryden:</p>

<h2><a name="XVI_THE_COVERLEY_WITCH" id="XVI_THE_COVERLEY_WITCH">XVI. THE COVERLEY WITCH</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 117. Saturday, July 14, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Ipsi sibi somnia fingunt.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>There are some opinions in which a man should stand
neuter,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> without engaging his assent to one side or the
other. Such a hovering faith as this, which refuses to
settle upon any determination, is absolutely necessary in
a mind that is careful to avoid errors and prepossessions. {<a href="#p129">5</a>}
When the arguments press equally on both sides, in matters
that are indifferent to us, the safest method is to give
up ourselves to neither.</p>

<p>It is with this temper of mind that I consider the subject
of witchcraft. When I hear the relations that are {10}
made from all parts of the world,&mdash;not only from Norway
and Lapland, from the East and West Indies, but
from every particular nation in Europe,&mdash;I cannot forbear
thinking that there is such an intercourse and commerce
with evil spirits as that which we express by the {15}
name of witchcraft. But when I consider that the ignorant
and credulous parts of the world abound most in
these relations, and that the persons among us who are
supposed to engage in such an infernal commerce are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
people of a weak understanding and a crazed imagination,
and at the same time reflect upon the many
impostures and delusions of this nature that have been
detected in all ages, I endeavour to suspend my belief till
I hear more certain accounts than any which have yet {<a href="#p130">5</a>}
come to my knowledge. In short, when I consider the
question whether there are such persons in the world as
those we call witches, my mind is divided between the
two opposite opinions; or rather, to speak my thoughts
freely, I believe in general that there is, and has been, {10}
such a thing as witchcraft; but at the same time can
give no credit to any particular instance of it.</p>

<p>I am engaged in this speculation by some occurrences
that I met with yesterday, which I shall give my reader
an account of at large. As I was walking with my friend {15}
Sir Roger by the side of one of his woods, an old woman
applied herself to me for my charity. Her dress and
figure put me in mind of the following description in
Otway:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"In a close lane as I pursued my journey, {20}</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">I spied a wrinkled hag, with age grown double,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Picking dry sticks, and mumbling to herself.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Her eyes with scalding rheum were gall'd and red;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Cold palsy shook her head; her hands seem'd wither'd;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And on her crooked shoulders had she wrapp'd {25}</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">The tatter'd remnants of an old striped hanging,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Which served to keep her carcase from the cold:</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">So there was nothing of a piece about her.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Her lower weeds<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> were all o'er coarsely patch'd</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">With diff'rent colour'd rags&mdash;black, red, white, yellow&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And seem'd to speak variety of wretchedness."</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As I was musing on this description and comparing it
with the object before me, the knight told me that this
very old woman had the reputation of a witch all over {<a href="#p131">5</a>}
the country, that her lips were observed to be always in
motion, and that there was not a switch about her house
which her neighbours did not believe had carried her
several hundreds of miles. If she chanced to stumble,
they always found sticks or straws that lay in the figure {10}
of a cross before her. If she made any mistake at
church, and cried "Amen" in a wrong place, they never
failed to conclude that she was saying her prayers backwards.
There was not a maid in the parish that would
take a pin of her, though she should offer a bag of money {15}
with it. She goes by the name of Moll White, and has
made the country ring with several imaginary exploits
which are palmed upon her. If the dairy maid does not
make her butter come so soon as she should have it,
Moll White is at the bottom of the churn. If a horse {20}
sweats in the stable, Moll White has been upon his back.
If a hare makes an unexpected escape from the hounds,
the huntsman curses Moll White. "Nay," says Sir Roger,
"I have known the master of the pack, upon such an
occasion, send one of his servants to see if Moll White {25}
had been out that morning."</p>

<p>This account raised my curiosity so far that I begged
my friend Sir Roger to go with me into her hovel, which
stood in a solitary corner under the side of the wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Upon our first entering, Sir Roger winked to me, and
pointed at something that stood behind the door, which,
upon looking that way, I found to be an old broomstaff.
At the same time, he whispered me in the ear to take
notice of a tabby cat that sat in the chimney-corner, {<a href="#p132">5</a>}
which, as the old knight told me, lay under as bad a
report as Moll White herself; for besides that Moll is
said often to accompany her in the same shape, the cat
is reported to have spoken twice or thrice in her life, and
to have played several pranks above the capacity of an {10}
ordinary cat.</p>

<p>I was secretly concerned to see human nature in so
much wretchedness and disgrace, but at the same time
could not forbear smiling to hear Sir Roger, who is a
little puzzled about the old woman, advising her, as a {15}
justice of peace, to avoid all communication with the
devil, and never to hurt any of her neighbours' cattle.
We concluded our visit with a bounty, which was very
acceptable.</p>

<p>In our return home, Sir Roger told me that old Moll {20}
had been often brought before him for making children
spit pins, and giving maids the nightmare; and that the
country people would be tossing her into a pond and
trying experiments with her every day, if it was not for
him and his chaplain. {25}</p>

<p>I have since found, upon inquiry, that Sir Roger was
several times staggered with the reports that had been
brought him concerning this old woman, and would frequently
have bound her over to the county sessions had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
not his chaplain with much ado persuaded him to the
contrary.</p>

<p>I have been the more particular in this account because
I hear there is scarce a village in England that has not
a Moll White in it. When an old woman begins to dote, {5}
and grow chargeable to a parish, she is generally turned
into a witch, and fills the whole country with extravagant
fancies, imaginary distempers, and terrifying dreams. In
the mean time the poor wretch that is the innocent occasion
of so many evils begins to be frighted at herself, and {10}
sometimes confesses secret commerce and familiarities
that her imagination forms in a delirious old age. This
frequently cuts off charity from the greatest objects of
compassion, and inspires people with a malevolence
towards those poor, decrepit parts of our species in {15}
whom human nature is defaced by infirmity and dotage.</p>

<h2><a name="XVII_SIR_ROGER_TALKS_OF_THE_WIDOW" id="XVII_SIR_ROGER_TALKS_OF_THE_WIDOW">XVII. SIR ROGER TALKS OF THE WIDOW</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 118. Monday, July 16, 1711. <span class="smcap">Steele.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Haeret lateri lethalis arundo.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>This agreeable seat is surrounded with so many pleasing
walks, which are struck out of a wood, in the midst
of which the house stands, that one can hardly ever be
weary of rambling from one labyrinth of delight to another. {20}
To one used to live in a city, the charms of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
are so exquisite that the mind is lost in a certain transport
which raises us above ordinary life, and yet is not
strong enough to be inconsistent with tranquillity. This
state of mind was I in, ravished with the murmur of waters,
the whisper of breezes, the singing of birds; and whether {5}
I looked up to the heavens, down on the earth, or turned
on the prospects around me, still struck with new sense of
pleasure; when I found, by the voice of my friend, who
walked by me, that we had insensibly strolled into the
grove sacred to the widow. {10}</p>

<p>"This woman," says he, "is of all others the most
unintelligible: she either designs to marry, or she does
not. What is the most perplexing of all is that she doth
not either say to her lovers she has any resolution against
that condition of life in general, or that she banishes {15}
them; but, conscious of her own merit, she permits their
addresses without fear of any ill consequence or want of
respect from their rage or despair. She has that in her
aspect against which it is impossible to offend. A man
whose thoughts are constantly bent upon so agreeable {20}
an object must be excused if the ordinary occurrences
in conversation are below his attention. I call her indeed
perverse; but, alas! why do I call her so? Because her
superior merit is such that I cannot approach her without
awe, that my heart is checked by too much esteem; I am {25}
angry that her charms are not more accessible, that I am
more inclined to worship than salute her. How often
have I wished her unhappy that I might have an opportunity
of serving her; and how often troubled in that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
imagination, at giving her the pain of being obliged!
Well, I have led a miserable life in secret upon her
account; but fancy she would have condescended to
have some regard for me if it had not been for that
watchful animal, her confidante. {5}</p>

<p>"Of all persons under the sun," continued he, calling
me by name, "be sure to set a mark upon confidantes;
they are of all people the most impertinent. What is most
pleasant<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to observe in them is that they assume to themselves
the merit of the persons whom they have in their {10}
custody. Orestilla is a great fortune, and in wonderful
danger of surprises; therefore full of suspicions of the least
indifferent thing, particularly careful of new acquaintance,
and of growing too familiar with the old. Themista, her
favourite woman, is every whit as careful of whom she {15}
speaks to, and what she says. Let the ward be a beauty,
her confidante shall treat you with an air of distance; let
her be a fortune, and she assumes the suspicious behaviour
of her friend and patroness. Thus it is that very many
of our unmarried women of distinction are to all intents {20}
and purposes married, except the consideration of different
sexes. They are directly under the conduct of their
whisperer, and think they are in a state of freedom while
they can prate with one of these attendants of all men in
general, and still avoid the man they most like.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> You do {25}
not see one heiress in a hundred whose fate does not
turn upon this circumstance of choosing a confidante.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Thus it is that the lady is addressed to,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> presented,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and
flattered, only by proxy, in her woman. In my case, how
is it possible that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Roger was proceeding in his harangue, when we
heard the voice of one speaking very importunately, and {5}
repeating these words: "What, not one smile?" We followed
the sound till we came to a close thicket, on the
other side of which we saw a young woman sitting as it
were in a personated<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> sullenness just over a transparent
fountain. Opposite to her stood Mr. William, Sir Roger's {10}
master of the game. The knight whispered me, "Hist,
these are lovers!" The huntsman, looking earnestly at
the shadow of the young maiden in the stream: "O
thou dear picture! if thou couldst remain there in the
absence of that fair creature whom you represent in the {15}
water, how willingly could I stand here satisfied for ever,
without troubling my dear Betty herself with any mention
of her unfortunate William, whom she is angry with;
but alas! when she pleases to be gone, thou wilt also
vanish;&mdash;yet let me talk to thee while thou dost stay. {20}
Tell my dearest Betty thou dost not more depend upon
her than does her William; her absence will make
away with me as well as thee. If she offers to remove
thee, I'll jump into these waves to lay hold on thee;
her, herself, her own dear person, I must never embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> {25}
again. Still do you hear me without one smile?&mdash;it is
too much to bear." He had no sooner spoke these
words, but he made an offer of throwing himself into the
water; at which his mistress started up, and at the next
instant he jumped across the fountain and met her in an {5}
embrace. She, half recovering from her fright, said in
the most charming voice imaginable, and with a tone of
complaint, "I thought how well you would drown yourself.
No, no, you won't drown yourself till you have
taken your leave of Susan Holliday." The huntsman, {10}
with a tenderness that spoke the most passionate love,
and with his cheek close to hers, whispered the softest
vows of fidelity in her ear, and cried, "Don't, my dear,
believe a word Kate Willow says; she is spiteful and
makes stories, because she loves to hear me talk to herself {15}
for your sake."</p>

<p>"Look you there," quoth Sir Roger, "do you see
there, all mischief comes from confidantes! But let us
not interrupt them; the maid is honest, and the man
dare not be otherwise, for he knows I loved her father; {20}
I will interpose in this matter, and hasten the wedding.
Kate Willow is a witty, mischievous wench in the neighborhood,
who was a beauty; and makes me hope I shall
see the perverse widow in her condition. She was so
flippant with her answers to all the honest fellows that {25}
came near her, and so very vain of her beauty, that she
has valued herself upon her charms till they are ceased.
She therefore now makes it her business to prevent other
young women from being more discreet than she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
herself; however, the saucy thing said the other day
well enough, 'Sir Roger and I must make a match, for
we are both despised by those we loved.' The hussy
has a great deal of power wherever she comes, and has
her share of cunning. {5}</p>

<p>"However, when I reflect upon this woman,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> I do not
know whether, in the main, I am the worse for having
loved her; whenever she is recalled to my imagination,
my youth returns, and I feel a forgotten warmth in my
veins. This affliction in my life has streaked all my conduct {10}
with a softness of which I should otherwise have
been incapable. It is, perhaps, to this dear image in
my heart owing, that I am apt to relent, that I easily
forgive, and that many desirable things are grown into
my temper which I should not have arrived at by better {15}
motives than the thought of being one day hers. I am
pretty well satisfied such a passion as I have had is never
well cured; and between you and me, I am often apt to
imagine it has had some whimsical effect upon my brain. For
I frequently find that in my most serious discourse I let {20}
fall some comical familiarity of speech or odd phrase that
makes the company laugh; however,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> I cannot but allow
she is a most excellent woman. When she is in the
country, I warrant she does not run into dairies, but
reads upon the nature of plants; but has a glass hive, {25}
and comes into the garden out of books<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> to see them<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and observe the policies of their commonwealth. She
understands everything. I'd give ten pounds to hear her
argue with my friend Sir Andrew Freeport about trade.
No, no; for all she looks so innocent, as it were, take
my word for it, she is no fool." {5}</p>

<p class="center">[No. 119. Tuesday, July 17, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Meliboee, putavi</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>The first and most obvious reflections which arise in a
man who changes the city for the country, are upon the
different manners of the people whom he meets with in
those two different scenes of life. By manners I do not
mean morals, but behaviour and good breeding as they {10}
show themselves in the town and in the country.</p>

<p>And here, in the first place, I must observe a very
great revolution that has happened in this article of good
breeding. Several<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> obliging deferences, condescensions,
and submissions, with many outward forms and ceremonies {15}
that accompany them, were first of all brought
up among the politer part of mankind, who lived in
courts and cities, and distinguished themselves from the
rustic part of the species&mdash;who on all occasions acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
bluntly and naturally&mdash;by such a mutual complaisance
and intercourse of civilities. These forms of conversation<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
by degrees multiplied and grew troublesome; the
modish<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> world found too great a constraint in them, and
have therefore thrown most of them aside. Conversation, {<a href="#p140">5</a>}
like the Romish religion, was so encumbered with
show and ceremony, that it stood in need of a reformation
to retrench its superfluities, and restore it to its
natural good sense and beauty. At present, therefore,
an unconstrained carriage, and a certain openness of behavior {10}
are the height of good breeding. The fashionable
world is grown free and easy; our manners sit more
loose upon us. Nothing is so modish as an agreeable
negligence. In a word, good breeding shows itself most
where, to an ordinary eye, it appears the least. {15}</p>

<p>If after this we look on the people of mode in the
country, we find in them the manners of the last age.
They have no sooner fetched themselves up to the fashion
of the polite world but the town has dropped them,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and
are<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> nearer to the first stage of nature than to those refinements {20}
which formerly reigned in the court and still prevail
in the country. One may now know a man that never
conversed in the world by his excess of good breeding.
A polite country squire shall make you as many bows in
half an hour as would serve a courtier for a week. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> {25}
is infinitely more to do about place and precedency
in a meeting of justices' wives than in an assembly of
duchesses.</p>

<p>This rural politeness is very troublesome to a man of
my temper, who generally take the chair that is next me, {5}
and walk first or last, in the front or in the rear, as
chance directs. I have known my friend Sir Roger's
dinner almost cold before the company could adjust the
ceremonial, and be prevailed upon to sit down; and
have heartily pitied my old friend, when I have seen him {10}
forced to pick and cull his guests, as they sat at the
several parts of his table, that he might drink their
healths according to their respective ranks and qualities.
Honest Will Wimble, who I should have thought had
been altogether uninfected with ceremony, gives me {15}
abundance of trouble in this particular. Though he has
been fishing all the morning, he will not help himself at
dinner till I am served. When we are going out of the
hall, he runs behind me; and last night, as we were walking
in the fields, stopped short at a stile till I came up to {20}
it, and upon my making signs to him to get over, told
me, with a serious smile, that, sure, I believed they had
no manners in the country.</p>

<p>There has happened another revolution in the point
of good breeding, which relates to the conversation {25}
among men of mode, and which I cannot but look
upon as very extraordinary. It was certainly one of the
first distinctions of a well-bred man to express everything
that had the most remote appearance of being obscene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in modest terms and distant phrases; whilst the clown,
who had no such delicacy of conception and expression,
clothed his ideas in most plain, homely terms that are
the most obvious and natural. This kind of good manners
was perhaps carried to an excess, so as to make {5}
conversation too stiff, formal, and precise; for which
reason (as hypocrisy in one age is generally succeeded
by atheism in another), conversation is in a great measure
relapsed into the first extreme; so that at present
several of our men of the town, and particularly those {10}
who have been polished in France, make use of the most
coarse, uncivilized words in our language, and utter
themselves often in such a manner as a clown would
blush to hear.</p>

<p>This infamous piece of good breeding which reigns {15}
among the coxcombs of the town has not yet made its
way into the country; and as it is impossible for such an
irrational way of conversation to last long among a people
that make any profession of religion, or show of
modesty, if the country gentlemen get into it they will {20}
certainly be left in the lurch. Their good breeding will
come too late to them, and they will be thought a parcel
of lewd clowns, while they fancy themselves talking
together like men of wit and pleasure.</p>

<p>As the two points of good breeding which I have {25}
hitherto insisted upon regard behaviour and conversation,
there is a third which turns upon dress. In this, too, the
country are<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> very much behindhand. The rural beaus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
are not yet got out of the fashion that took place at the
time of the Revolution, but ride about the country in red
coats and laced hats, while the women in many parts are
still trying to outvie one another in the height of their
head-dresses. {<a href="#p143">5</a>}</p>

<p>But a friend of mine, who is now upon the western
circuit, having promised to give me an account of the
several modes and fashions that prevail in the different
parts of the nation through which he passes, I shall defer
the enlarging upon this last topic till I have received a {10}
letter from him, which I expect every post.</p>

<p class="center">[No. 122. Friday, July 20, 1711. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Comes iucundus in via pro vehiculo est.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Publ. Syr.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>A man's first care should be to avoid the reproaches of
his own heart; his next, to escape the censures of the
world. If the last interferes with the former, it ought to
be entirely neglected; but otherwise there cannot be a {15}
greater satisfaction to an honest mind than to see those
approbations which it gives itself seconded by the applauses
of the public. A man is more sure of his conduct
when the verdict which he passes upon his own behaviour
is thus warranted and confirmed by the opinion of all {20}
that know him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>My worthy friend Sir Roger is one of those who is not
only at peace within himself, but beloved and esteemed
by all about him. He receives a suitable tribute for his
universal benevolence to mankind in the returns of affection
and good-will which are paid him by every one that {<a href="#p144">5</a>}
lives within his neighbourhood. I lately met with two or
three odd instances of that general respect which is shown
to the good old knight. He would needs carry Will
Wimble and myself with him to the county assizes. As
we were upon the road, Will Wimble joined a couple of {10}
plain men who rid before us, and conversed with them for
some time; during which my friend Sir Roger acquainted
me with their characters.</p>

<p>"The first of them," says he, "that has a spaniel by
his side, is a yeoman of about an hundred pounds a year, {15}
an honest man. He is just within the Game Act and
qualified to kill an hare or a pheasant. He knocks down
a dinner with his gun twice or thrice a week; and by that
means lives much cheaper than those who have not so
good an estate as himself. He would be a good neighbour {20}
if he did not destroy so many partridges; in short, he is
a very sensible man, shoots flying,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and has been several
times foreman of the petty jury.</p>

<p>"The other that rides along with him is Tom Touchy,
a fellow famous for taking the law of everybody. There {25}
is not one in the town where he lives that he has not sued
at a quarter sessions. The rogue had once the impudence
to go to law with the widow. His head is full of costs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
damages, and ejectments; he plagued a couple of honest
gentlemen so long for a trespass in breaking one of his
hedges, till<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> he was forced to sell the ground it enclosed
to defray the charges of the prosecution. His father left
him fourscore pounds a year, but he has cast and been {<a href="#p145">5</a>}
cast<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> so often that he is not now worth thirty. I suppose
he is going upon the old business of the willow tree."</p>

<p>As Sir Roger was giving me this account of Tom
Touchy, Will Wimble and his two companions stopped
short till we came up to them. After having paid their {10}
respects to Sir Roger, Will told him that Mr. Touchy and
he must appeal to him upon a dispute that arose between
them. Will, it seems, had been giving his fellow-traveller
an account of his angling one day in such a hole; when
Tom Touchy, instead of hearing out his story, told him {15}
that Mr. Such-an-one, if he pleased, might take the law
of him for fishing in that part of the river. My friend
Sir Roger heard them both, upon a round trot; and, after
having paused some time, told them, with the air of a man
who would not give his judgment rashly, that much might {20}
be said on both sides. They were neither of them dissatisfied
with the knight's determination, because neither of
them found himself in the wrong by it. Upon which we
made the best of our way to the assizes.</p>

<p>The court was sat before Sir Roger came; but notwithstanding {25}
all the justices had taken their places upon the
bench, they made room for the old knight at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
them; who, for his reputation in the country, took occasion
to whisper in the judge's ear that he was glad his
lordship had met with so much good weather in his circuit.
I was listening to the proceeding of the court with
much attention, and infinitely pleased with that great {<a href="#p146">5</a>}
appearance and solemnity which so properly accompanies
such a public administration of our laws, when, after about
an hour's sitting, I observed, to my great surprise, in the
midst of a trial, that my friend Sir Roger was getting up
to speak. I was in some pain for him, till I found he {10}
had acquitted himself of two or three sentences with a
look of much business and great intrepidity.</p>

<p>Upon his first rising, the court was hushed, and a general
whisper ran among the country people that Sir Roger
was up. The speech he made was so little to the purpose {15}
that I shall not trouble my readers with an account of it;
and I believe was not so much designed by the knight
himself to inform the court, as to give him a figure in my
eye, and keep up his credit in the country.</p>

<p>I was highly delighted, when the court rose, to see the {20}
gentlemen of the country gathering about my old friend,
and striving who should compliment him most; at the
same time that the ordinary people gazed upon him at a
distance, not a little admiring his courage, that was not
afraid to speak to the judge. {25}</p>

<p>In our return home we met with a very odd accident
which I cannot forbear relating, because it shows how
desirous all who know Sir Roger are of giving him marks
of their esteem. When we arrived upon the verge of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
estate, we stopped at a little inn to rest ourselves and our
horses. The man of the house had, it seems, been formerly
a servant in the knight's family; and, to do honour
to his old master, had some time since, unknown to Sir
Roger, put him up in a sign-post before the door; so that {<a href="#p147">5</a>}
the knight's head had hung out upon the road about a
week before he himself knew anything of the matter. As
soon as Sir Roger was acquainted with it, finding that
his servant's indiscretion proceeded wholly from affection
and good-will, he only told him that he had made him {10}
too high a compliment; and when the fellow seemed to
think that could hardly be, added with a more decisive
look, that it was too great an honour for any man under
a duke; but told him at the same time that it might be
altered with a very few touches, and that he himself {15}
would be at the charge of it. Accordingly they got a
painter, by the knight's directions, to add a pair of whiskers
to the face, and by a little aggravation of the features
to change it into the Saracen's Head. I should not have
known this story had not the innkeeper, upon Sir Roger's {20}
alighting, told him in my hearing that his honour's head
was brought back last night with the alterations that he
had ordered to be made in it. Upon this, my friend,
with his usual cheerfulness, related the particulars above
mentioned, and ordered the head to be brought into the {25}
room. I could not forbear discovering greater expressions
of mirth than ordinary upon the appearance of this
monstrous face, under which, notwithstanding it was made
to frown and stare in a most extraordinary manner, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
could still discover<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> a distant resemblance of my old friend.
Sir Roger, upon seeing me laugh, desired me to tell him
truly if I thought it possible for people to know him in
that disguise. I at first kept my usual silence; but upon
the knight's conjuring me to tell him whether it was not {5}
still more like himself than a Saracen, I composed my
countenance in the best manner I could, and replied that
much might be said on both sides.</p>

<p>These several adventures, with the knight's behaviour
in them, gave me as pleasant a day as ever I met with in {10}
any of my travels.</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Hor.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>As I was yesterday taking the air with my friend Sir
Roger, we were met by a fresh-coloured, ruddy young man,
who rid by us full speed, with a couple of servants behind
him. Upon my inquiry who he was, Sir Roger told me {15}
that he was a young gentleman of a considerable estate,
who had been educated by a tender mother, that lives not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
many miles from the place where we were. She is a very
good lady, says my friend, but took so much care of her
son's health, that she has made him good for nothing.
She quickly found that reading was bad for his eyes,
and that writing made his head ache. He was let loose {<a href="#p149">5</a>}
among the woods as soon as he was able to ride on horse-back,
or to carry a gun upon his shoulder. To be brief,
I found by my friend's account of him, that he had got
a great stock of health, but nothing else; and that, if it
were a man's business only to live, there would not be a {10}
more accomplished young fellow in the whole country.</p>

<p>The truth of it is, since my residing in these parts I
have seen and heard innumerable instances of young
heirs and elder brothers who&mdash;either from their own
reflecting upon the estates they are born to, and therefore {15}
thinking all other accomplishments unnecessary; or from
hearing these notions frequently inculcated to them by the
flattery of their servants and domestics; or from the same
foolish thought prevailing in those who have the care of
their education&mdash;are of no manner of use but to keep {20}
up their families, and transmit their lands and houses in
a line to posterity.</p>

<p>This makes me often think on a story I have heard of
two friends, which I shall give my reader at large under
feigned names. The moral of it may, I hope, be useful, {25}
though there are some circumstances which make it rather
appear like a novel than a true story.</p>

<p>Eudoxus and Leontine began the world with small
estates. They were both of them men of good sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and great virtue. They prosecuted their studies together
in their earlier years, and entered into such a friendship
as lasted to the end of their lives. Eudoxus, at his first
setting out in the world, threw himself into a court, where
by his natural endowments and his acquired abilities he {<a href="#p150">5</a>}
made his way from one post to another, till at length he
had raised a very considerable fortune. Leontine, on the
contrary, sought all opportunities of improving his mind
by study, conversation, and travel. He was not only
acquainted with all the sciences, but with the most eminent {10}
professors of them throughout Europe. He knew
perfectly well the interests of its princes, with the customs
and fashions of their courts, and could scarce meet
with the name of an extraordinary person in the <cite>Gazette</cite>
whom he had not either talked to or seen. In short, he {15}
had so well mixed and digested his knowledge of men
and books, that he made one of the most accomplished
persons of his age. During the whole course of his
studies and travels, he kept up a punctual correspondence
with Eudoxus, who often made himself acceptable to the {20}
principal men about court by the intelligence which he
received from Leontine. When they were both turned of
forty,&mdash;an age in which, according to Mr. Cowley, "there
is no dallying with life,"&mdash;they determined, pursuant to
the resolution they had taken in the beginning of their {25}
lives, to retire, and pass the remainder of their days in
the country. In order to this, they both of them married
much about the same time. Leontine, with his own and
his wife's fortune, bought a farm of three hundred a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
which lay within the neighbourhood of his friend Eudoxus,
who had purchased an estate of as many thousands.
They were both of them fathers about the same time;
Eudoxus having a son born to him, and Leontine a
daughter: but, to the unspeakable grief of the latter, his {5}
young wife, in whom all his happiness was wrapt up, died
in a few days after the birth of her daughter. His affliction
would have been insupportable had not he been
comforted by the daily visits and conversations of his
friend. As they were one day talking together with their {10}
usual intimacy, Leontine considering how incapable he
was of giving his daughter a proper education in his own
house, and Eudoxus reflecting on the ordinary behaviour
of a son who knows himself to be the heir of a great
estate, they both agreed upon an exchange of children: {15}
namely, that the boy should be bred up with Leontine as
his son, and that the girl should live with Eudoxus as his
daughter, till they were each of them arrived at years of
discretion. The wife of Eudoxus, knowing that her son
could not be so advantageously brought up as under the {20}
care of Leontine, and considering at the same time that
he would be perpetually under her own eye, was by degrees
prevailed upon to fall in with the project. She
therefore took Leonilla, for that was the name of the girl,
and educated her as her own daughter. The two friends {25}
on each side had wrought themselves to such an habitual
tenderness for the children who were under their direction,
that each of them had the real passion of a father,
where the title was but imaginary. Florio, the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the young heir that lived with Leontine, though he had
all the duty and affection imaginable for his supposed
parent, was taught to rejoice at the sight of Eudoxus,
who visited his friend very frequently, and was dictated
by his natural affection, as well as by the rules of prudence, {<a href="#p152">5</a>}
to make himself esteemed and beloved by Florio.
The boy was now old enough to know his supposed
father's circumstances, and that therefore he was to make
his way in the world by his own industry. This consideration
grew stronger in him every day, and produced so {10}
good an effect that he applied himself with more than
ordinary attention to the pursuit of everything which
Leontine recommended to him. His natural abilities,
which were very good, assisted by the directions of so
excellent a counsellor, enabled him to make a quicker {15}
progress than ordinary through all the parts of his education.
Before he was twenty years of age, having finished
his studies and exercises with great applause, he was removed
from the university to the Inns of Court, where
there are very few that make themselves considerable {20}
proficients in the studies of the place<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> who know they
shall arrive at great estates without them. This was not
Florio's case: he found that three hundred a year was but
a poor estate for Leontine and himself to live upon, so
that he studied without intermission till he gained a very {25}
good insight into the constitution and laws of his country.</p>

<p>I should have told my reader, that whilst Florio lived
at the house of his foster-father, he was always an accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>able
guest in the family of Eudoxus, where he became
acquainted with Leonilla from her infancy. His acquaintance
with her by degrees grew into love, which in a mind
trained up in all the sentiments of honour and virtue became
a very uneasy passion. He despaired of gaining {5}
an heiress of so great a fortune, and would rather have
died than attempted it by any indirect methods. Leonilla,
who was a woman of the greatest beauty joined with the
greatest modesty, entertained at the same time a secret
passion for Florio, but conducted herself with so much {10}
prudence that she never gave him the least intimation
of it. Florio was now engaged in all those arts and
improvements that are proper to raise a man's private
fortune, and give him a figure in his country, but secretly
tormented with that passion which burns with the greatest {15}
fury in a virtuous and noble heart, when he received a
sudden summons from Leontine to repair to him into
the country the next day. For it seems Eudoxus was so
filled with the report of his son's reputation that he could
no longer withhold making himself known to him. The {20}
morning after his arrival at the house of his supposed
father, Leontine told him that Eudoxus had something of
great importance to communicate to him; upon which the
good man embraced him and wept. Florio was no sooner
arrived at the great house that stood in his neighbourhood {25}
but Eudoxus took him by the hand, after the first salutes<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
were over, and conducted him into his closet. He there
opened<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> to him the whole secret of his parentage and edu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>cation,
concluding after this manner: "I have no other
way left of acknowledging my gratitude to Leontine than
by marrying you to his daughter. He shall not lose the
pleasure of being your father by the discovery I have
made to you. Leonilla, too, shall be still my daughter; {5}
her filial piety, though misplaced, has been so exemplary
that it deserves the greatest reward I can confer upon it.
You shall have the pleasure of seeing a great estate fall
to you, which you would have lost the relish of had you
known yourself born to it. Continue only to deserve it {10}
in the same manner you did before you were possessed of
it. I have left your mother in the next room. Her heart
yearns towards you. She is making the same discoveries
to Leonilla which I have made to yourself." Florio was
so overwhelmed with this profusion of happiness that he {15}
was not able to make a reply, but threw himself down at
his father's feet, and amidst a flood of tears kissed and
embraced his knees, asking his blessing, and expressing in
dumb show those sentiments of love, duty, and gratitude
that were too big for utterance. To conclude, the happy {20}
pair were married, and half Eudoxus's estate settled upon
them. Leontine and Eudoxus passed the remainder of
their lives together; and received in the dutiful and affectionate
behaviour of Florio and Leonilla the just recompense,
as well as the natural effects, of that care which {25}
they had bestowed upon them in their education.</p>

<p>My worthy friend, Sir Roger, when we are talking of the
malice of parties, very frequently tells us an accident that
happened to him when he was a schoolboy, which was at a
time when the feuds ran high between the Roundheads
and Cavaliers. This worthy knight, being then but a stripling, {<a href="#p155">5</a>}
had occasion to inquire which was the way to St. Anne's
Lane; upon which the person whom he spoke to, instead
of answering his question, called him a young popish cur,
and asked him who had made Anne a saint! The boy,
being in some confusion, inquired of the next he met, {10}
which was the way to Anne's Lane; but was called a
prick-eared cur for his pains, and instead of being shown
the way, was told that she had been a saint before he was
born, and would be one after he was hanged. "Upon
this," says sir Roger, "I did not think fit to repeat the {15}
former question, but going into every lane of the neighbourhood,
asked what they called the name of that lane."
By which ingenious artifice, he found out the place he
inquired after without giving offence to any party. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Roger generally closes this narrative with reflections on
the mischief that parties do in the country; how they spoil
good neighbourhood, and make honest gentlemen hate one
another; besides that they manifestly tend to the prejudice
of the land-tax, and the destruction of the game. {<a href="#p156">5</a>}</p>

<p>There cannot a greater judgment befall a country than
such a dreadful spirit of division as rends a government
into two distinct people, and makes them greater strangers
and more averse to one another than if they were
actually two different nations. The effects of such a division {10}
are pernicious to the last degree, not only with regard
to those advantages which they give the common enemy,
but to those private evils which they produce in the heart
of almost every particular person. This influence is very
fatal both to men's morals and their understandings; it {15}
sinks the virtue of a nation, and not only so, but destroys
even common sense.</p>

<p>A furious party spirit, when it rages in its full violence,
exerts itself in civil war and bloodshed; and when it is
under its greatest restraints naturally breaks out in false-hood, {20}
detraction, calumny, and a partial administration of
justice. In a word, it fills a nation with spleen and rancour,
and extinguishes all the seeds of good-nature, compassion,
and humanity.</p>

<p>Plutarch says, very finely, that a man should not allow {25}
himself to hate even his enemies;&mdash;"Because," says he,
"if you indulge this passion in some occasions, it will rise
of itself in others; if you hate your enemies, you will contract
such a vicious habit of mind as by degrees will break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
out upon those who are your friends, or those who are
indifferent to you." I might here observe how admirably
this precept of morality&mdash;which derives the malignity of
hatred from the passion itself, and not from its object&mdash;answers
to that great rule which was dictated to the world {<a href="#p157">5</a>}
about an hundred years before this philosopher wrote;
but instead of that, I shall only take notice, with a real
grief of heart, that the minds of many good men among
us appear soured with party principles, and alienated from
one another in such a manner as seems to me altogether {10}
inconsistent with the dictates either of reason or religion.
Zeal for a public cause is apt to breed passions in the
hearts of virtuous persons to which the regard of their
own private interest would never have betrayed them.</p>

<p>If this party spirit has so ill an effect on our morals, it {15}
has likewise a very great one upon our judgements. We
often hear a poor, insipid paper or pamphlet cried up,
and sometimes a noble piece depreciated, by those who
are of a different principle from the author. One who is
actuated by this spirit is almost under an incapacity of {20}
discerning either real blemishes or beauties. A man
of merit in a different principle,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> is like an object seen in
two different mediums,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> that appears crooked or broken,
however straight or entire it may be in itself. For this
reason, there is scarce a person of any figure in England {25}
who does not go by two contrary characters, as opposite
to one another as light and darkness. Knowledge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
learning suffer in a particular manner from this strange
prejudice, which at present prevails amongst all ranks and
degrees in the British nation. As men formerly became
eminent in learned societies by their parts and acquisitions,
they now distinguish themselves by the warmth and {<a href="#p158">5</a>}
violence with which they espouse their respective parties.
Books are valued upon the like consideration: an abusive,
scurrilous style passes for satire, and a dull scheme of
party notions is called fine writing.</p>

<p>There is one piece of sophistry practiced by both sides; {10}
and that is the taking any scandalous story that has been
ever whispered or invented of a private man, for a known,
undoubted truth, and raising suitable speculations upon it.
Calumnies that have been never proved, or have been often
refuted, are the ordinary <i lang="la">postulatums</i><a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> of these infamous {15}
scribblers, upon which they proceed as upon first principles
granted by all men, though in their hearts they know
they are false, or at best very doubtful. When they have
laid these foundations of scurrility, it is no wonder that
their superstructure is every way answerable to them. If {20}
this shameless practice of the present age endures much
longer, praise and reproach will cease to be motives of
action in good men.</p>

<p>There are certain periods of time in all governments when
this inhuman spirit prevails. Italy was long torn in pieces {25}
by the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and France by those who
were for and against the League; but it is very unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
for a man to be born in such a stormy and tempestuous
season. It is the restless ambition of artful men that
thus breaks a people into factions, and draws several well-meaning
persons to their interest by a specious concern
for their country. How many honest minds are filled with {5}
uncharitable and barbarous notions, out of their zeal for
the public good! What cruelties and outrages would they
not commit against men of an adverse party, whom they
would honour and esteem, if, instead of considering them
as they are represented, they knew them as they are! {10}
Thus are persons of the greatest probity seduced into
shameful errors and prejudices, and made bad men even
by that noblest of principles, the "love of their country."
I cannot here forbear mentioning the famous Spanish
proverb, "If there were neither fools nor knaves in the {15}
world, all people would be of one mind."</p>

<p>For my own part, I could heartily wish that all honest
men would enter into an association for the support of one
another against the endeavours of those whom they ought
to look upon as their common enemies, whatsoever side {20}
they may belong to. Were there such an honest body of
neutral forces, we should never see the worst of men in
great figures of life, because they are useful to a party;
nor the best unregarded, because they are above practising
those methods which would be grateful to their {25}
faction. We should then single every criminal out of
the herd, and hunt him down, however formidable and
overgrown he might appear: on the contrary, we should
shelter distressed innocence, and defend virtue, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
beset with contempt or ridicule, envy, or defamation. In
short, we should not any longer regard our fellow subjects
as Whigs or Tories, but should make the man of merit our
friend, and the villain our enemy.</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>In my yesterday's paper, I proposed that the honest {5}
men of all parties should enter into a kind of association
for the defence of one another, and the confusion of their
common enemies. As it is designed this neutral body
should act with a regard to nothing but truth and equity,
and divest themselves of the little heats and prepossessions {10}
that cleave to parties of all kinds, I have prepared
for them the following form of an association, which may
express their intentions in the most plain and simple
manner:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We whose names are hereunto subscribed, do solemnly declare {15}
that we do in our consciences believe two and two make four; and
that we shall adjudge any man whatsoever to be our enemy who
endeavors to persuade us to the contrary. We are likewise ready
to maintain, with the hazard of all that is near and dear to us, that
six is less than seven in all times and all places, and that ten will {20}
not be more three years hence than it is at present. We do also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
firmly declare that it is our resolution as long as we live to call
black black, and white white; and we shall upon all occasions oppose
such persons that upon any day of the year shall call black
white, or white black, with the utmost peril of our lives and
fortunes. {<a href="#p161">5</a>}</p></blockquote>

<p>Were there such a combination of honest men, who
without any regard to places would endeavour to extirpate
all such furious zealots as would sacrifice one half of their
country to the passion and interest of the other; as also
such infamous hypocrites that are for promoting their {10}
own advantage under colour of the public good; with all
the profligate, immoral retainers to each side, that have
nothing to recommend them but an implicit submission
to their leaders;&mdash;we should soon see that furious party
spirit extinguished, which may in time expose us to the {15}
derision and contempt of all the nations about us.</p>

<p>A member of this society that would thus carefully
employ himself in making room for merit, by throwing
down the worthless and depraved part of mankind from
those conspicuous stations of life to which they have been {20}
sometimes advanced, and all this without any regard to
his private interest, would be no small benefactor to his
country.</p>

<p>I remember to have read in Diodorus Siculus an account
of a very active little animal, which I think he calls the {25}
ichneumon, that makes it the whole business of his life to
break the eggs of the crocodile, which he is always in
search after. This instinct is the more remarkable because
the ichneumon never feeds upon the eggs he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
broken, nor in any other way finds his account in them.
Were it not for the incessant labours of this industrious
animal, Egypt, says the historian, would be overrun with
crocodiles; for the Egyptians are so far from destroying
those pernicious creatures that they worship them as {<a href="#p162">5</a>}
gods.</p>

<p>If we look into the behaviour of ordinary partisans, we
shall find them far from resembling this disinterested
animal, and rather acting after the example of the wild
Tartars, who are ambitious of destroying a man of the {10}
most extraordinary parts and accomplishments, as thinking
that upon his decease the same talents, whatever post
they qualified him for, enter of course into his destroyer.</p>

<p>As in the whole train of my speculations I have endeavoured,
as much as I am able, to extinguish that pernicious {15}
spirit of passion and prejudice which rages with the same
violence in all parties, I am still the more desirous of
doing some good in this particular because I observe that
the spirit of party reigns more in the country than in the
town. It here contracts a kind of brutality and rustic {20}
fierceness to which men of a politer conversation are
wholly strangers. It extends itself even to the return of
the bow and the hat; and at the same time that the
heads of parties preserve toward one another an outward
show of good breeding, and keep up a perpetual intercourse {25}
of civilities, their tools that are dispersed in these
outlying parts will not so much as mingle together at a
cock-match. This humour fills the country with several
periodical meetings of Whig jockeys and Tory fox hunters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
not to mention the innumerable curses, frowns, and whispers
it produces at a quarter sessions.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I have observed, in any of my
former papers, that my friends Sir Roger de Coverley and
Sir Andrew Freeport are of different principles; the first {<a href="#Page_163">5</a>}
of them inclined to the landed, and the other to the moneyed
interest. This humour is so moderate in each of
them that it proceeds no farther than to an agreeable
raillery, which very often diverts the rest of the club. I
find, however, that the knight is a much stronger Tory {10}
in the country than in town, which, as he has told me in
my ear, is absolutely necessary for the keeping up his
interest. In all our journey from London to his house,
we did not so much as bait at a Whig inn; or if by
chance the coachman stopped at a wrong place, one of {15}
Sir Roger's servants would ride up to his master full
speed, and whisper to him that the master of the house
was against such an one in the last election. This often
betrayed us into hard beds and bad cheer; for we were
not so inquisitive about the inn as the innkeeper; and {20}
provided our landlord's principles were sound, did not
take any notice of the staleness of his provisions. This
I found still the more inconvenient because the better the
host was, the worse generally were his accommodations;
the fellow knowing very well that those who were his {25}
friends would take up with coarse diet and an hard
lodging. For these reasons, all the while I was upon the
road I dreaded entering into an house of any one that
Sir Roger had applauded for an honest man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Since my stay at Sir Roger's in the country, I daily find
more instance of this narrow party humour. Being upon a
bowling green at a neighbouring market town the other day
(for that is the place where the gentlemen of one side
meet once a week), I observed a stranger among them of {<a href="#p164">5</a>}
a better presence and genteeler behaviour than ordinary;
but was much surprised that, notwithstanding he was a
very fair better, nobody would take him up. But upon
inquiry, I found that he was one who had given a disagreeable
vote in a former parliament, for which reason {10}
there was not a man upon that bowling green who would
have so much correspondence with him as to win his
money of him.</p>

<p>Among other instances of this nature, I must not omit
one which concerns myself. Will Wimble was the other {15}
day relating several strange stories, that he had picked up,
nobody knows where, of a certain great man; and upon
my staring at him, as one that was surprised to hear such
things in the country, which had never been so much as
whispered in the town, Will stopped short in the thread {20}
of his discourse, and after dinner asked my friend Sir
Roger in his ear if he was sure that I was not a
fanatic.</p>

<p>It gives me a serious concern to see such a spirit of
dissension in the country; not only as it destroys virtue {25}
and common sense, and renders us in a manner barbarians
towards one another, but as it perpetuates our animosities,
widens our breaches, and transmits our present passions
and prejudices to our posterity. For my own part, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
sometimes afraid that I discover the seeds of a civil war
in these our divisions, and therefore cannot but bewail, as
in their first principles, the miseries and calamities of our
children.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p>As I was yesterday riding out in the fields with my {5}
friend Sir Roger, we saw at a little distance from us a
troop of gipsies. Upon the first discovery of them, my
friend was in some doubt whether he should not exert the
justice of the peace<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> upon such a band of lawless vagrants;
but not having his clerk with him, who is a necessary {10}
counsellor on these occasions, and fearing that his poultry
might fare the worse for it, he let the thought drop; but
at the same time gave me a particular account of the mischiefs
they do in the country, in stealing people's goods
and spoiling their servants. "If a stray piece of linen {15}
hangs upon an hedge," says Sir Roger, "they are sure to
have it; if a hog loses his way in the fields, it is ten to
one but he becomes their prey; our geese cannot live in
peace for them; if a man prosecutes them with severity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
his hen-roost is sure to pay for it. They generally straggle
into these parts about this time of the year, and set the
heads of our servant-maids so agog for husbands that we
do not expect to have any business done as it should be
whilst they are in the country. I have an honest dairy-maid {<a href="#p166">5</a>}
who crosses their hands with a piece of silver every
summer, and never fails being promised the handsomest
young fellow in the parish for her pains. Your friend,
the butler, has been fool enough to be seduced by them;
and, though he is sure to lose a knife, a fork, or a spoon, {10}
every time his fortune is told him, generally shuts himself
up in the pantry with an old gipsy for above half an hour
once in a twelvemonth. Sweethearts are the things they
live upon, which they bestow very plentifully upon all
those that apply themselves to them. You see, now {15}
and then, some handsome young jades among them;
the [wenches] have very often white teeth and black
eyes."</p>

<p>Sir Roger, observing that I listened with great attention
to his account of a people who were so entirely new to me, {20}
told me that if I would they should tell us our fortunes.
As I was very well pleased with the knight's proposal,
we rid up and communicated our hands to them. A
Cassandra of the crew, after having examined my lines<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
very diligently, told me that I loved a pretty maid in a {25}
corner; that I was a good woman's man; with some
other particulars which I do not think proper to relate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
My friend Sir Roger alighted from his horse, and exposing
his palm to two or three that stood by him, they crumpled
it into all shapes, and diligently scanned every wrinkle
that could be made in it; when one of them, who was
older and more sunburnt than the rest, told him that he {5}
had a widow in his line of life<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>; upon which the knight
cried, "Go, go, you are an idle baggage!" and at the
same time smiled upon me. The gipsy, finding he was
not displeased in his heart, told him, after a farther inquiry
into his hand, that his true love was constant, and {10}
that she should dream of him to-night. My old friend
cried "Pish!" and bid her go on. The gipsy told him
that he was a bachelor, but would not be so long; and
that he was dearer to somebody than he thought. The
knight still repeated she was an idle baggage, and bid her {15}
go on. "Ah, master," says the gipsy, "that roguish leer
of yours makes a pretty woman's heart ache; you ha'n't
that simper about the mouth for nothing&mdash;." The uncouth
gibberish with which all this was uttered, like the
darkness of an oracle, made us the more attentive to it. {20}
To be short, the knight left the money with her that he
had crossed her hand with, and got up again on his
horse.</p>

<p>As we were riding away, Sir Roger told me that he
knew several sensible people who believed these gipsies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> {25}
now and then foretold very strange things; and for half
an hour together appeared more jocund than ordinary.
In the height of his good humour, meeting a common beggar
upon the road who was no conjurer, as he went to
relieve him, he found his pocket was picked; that being {5}
a kind of palmistry at which this race of vermin are very
dextrous.</p>

<p>I might here entertain my reader with historical remarks
on this idle, profligate people, who infest all the
countries of Europe, and live in the midst of governments {10}
in a kind of commonwealth by themselves. But instead
of entering into observations of this nature, I shall fill
the remaining part of my paper with a story which is
still fresh in Holland, and was printed in one of our
monthly accounts about twenty years ago: {15}</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As the <i>trekschuyt</i>, or hackney boat, which carries passengers
from Leyden to Amsterdam, was putting off, a boy running along
the side of the canal desired to be taken in; which the master of
the boat refused, because the lad had not quite money enough to
pay the usual fare. An eminent merchant, being pleased with the {20}
looks of the boy and secretly touched with compassion towards
him, paid the money for him, and ordered him to be taken on
board.</p>

<p>"Upon talking with him afterwards, he found that he could speak
readily in three or four languages, and learned upon farther examination {25}
that he had been stolen away when he was a child, by a
gypsy, and had rambled ever since with a gang of those strollers
up and down several parts of Europe. It happened that the merchant,
whose heart seems to have inclined towards the boy by a
secret kind of instinct, had himself lost a child some years before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> {30}
The parents, after a long search for him, gave him for drowned<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
in one of the canals with which that country abounds; and the
mother was so afflicted at the loss of a fine boy, who was her only
son, that she died for grief of it.</p>

<p>"Upon laying together all particulars, and examining the several {5}
moles and marks by which the mother used to describe the child
when he was first missing, the boy proved to be the son of the
merchant whose heart had so unaccountably melted at the sight of
him. The lad was very well pleased to find a father who was so
rich, and likely to leave him a good estate: the father, on the {10}
other hand, was not a little delighted to see a son return to him,
whom he had given for lost, with such a strength of constitution,
sharpness of understanding, and skill in languages."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the printed story leaves off; but if I may give
credit to reports, our linguist having received such extraordinary {15}
rudiments towards a good education, was
afterwards trained up in everything that becomes a gentleman;
wearing off by little and little all the vicious habits
and practices that he had been used to in the course of his
peregrinations. Nay, it is said that he has since been {20}
employed in foreign courts upon national business, with
great reputation to himself and honour to those who sent
him, and that he has visited several countries as a public
minister, in which he formerly wandered as a gipsy.</p>

TO LONDON</a></h2>

<p>It is usual for a man who loves country sports to preserve
the game in his own grounds, and divert himself
upon those that belong to his neighbour. My friend Sir
Roger generally goes two or three miles from his house,
and gets into the frontiers of his estate, before he beats {5}
about in search of an hare or partridge, on purpose to
spare his own fields, where he is always sure of finding
diversion when the worst comes to the worst. By this
means the breed about his house has time to increase
and multiply; besides that the sport is the more agreeable {10}
where the game is the harder to come at, and
does not lie so thick as to produce any perplexity or
confusion in the pursuit. For these reasons the country
gentleman, like the fox, seldom preys near his own home.
In the same manner I have made a month's excursion {15}
out of the town, which is the great field of game for
sportsmen of my species, to try my fortune in the country,
where I have started several subjects and hunted
them down, with some pleasure to myself, and I hope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
others. I am here forced to use a great deal of diligence
before I can spring anything to my mind; whereas in
town, whilst I am following one character, it is ten to
one but I am crossed in my way by another, and put up
such a variety of odd creatures in both sexes that they {<a href="#p171">5</a>}
foil the scent of one another, and puzzle the chase. My
greatest difficulty in the country is to find sport, and, in
town, to choose it. In the meantime, as I have given a
whole month's rest to the cities of London and Westminster,
I promise myself abundance of new game upon {10}
my return thither.</p>

<p>It is indeed high time for me to leave the country,
since I find the whole neighbourhood begin to grow very
inquisitive after my name and character; my love of solitude,
taciturnity, and particular way of life, having raised {15}
a great curiosity in all these parts.</p>

<p>The notions which have been framed of me are various:
some look upon me as very proud, and some as
very melancholy. Will Wimble, as my friend the butler
tells me, observing me very much alone, and extremely {20}
silent when I am in company, is afraid I have killed a
man. The country people seem to suspect me for a conjurer;
and, some of them hearing of the visit which I
made to Moll White, will needs have it that Sir Roger has
brought down a cunning man with him, to cure the old {25}
woman, and free the country from her charms. So that
the character which I go under in part of the neighbourhood,
is what they here call a "White Witch."</p>

<p>A justice of peace, who lives about five miles off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
is not of Sir Roger's party, has, it seems, said twice or
thrice at his table that he wishes Sir Roger does not
harbor a Jesuit in his house, and that he thinks the gentlemen
of the country would do very well to make me
give some account of myself. {<a href="#p172">5</a>}</p>

<p>On the other side, some of Sir Roger's friends are
afraid the old knight is imposed upon by a designing
fellow, and as they have heard that he converses very
promiscuously when he is in town, do not know but he
has brought down with him some discarded Whig, that is {10}
sullen and says nothing because he is out of place.</p>

<p>Such is the variety of opinions which are here entertained
of me, so that I pass among some for a disaffected
person, and among others for a popish priest; among
some for a wizard, and among others for a murderer: and {15}
all this for no other reason, that I can imagine, but because
I do not hoot and hollow and make a noise. It is
true my friend Sir Roger tells them, that it is my way,
and that I am only a philosopher; but that will not satisfy
them. They think there is more in me than he discovers, {20}
and that I do not hold my tongue for nothing.</p>

<p>For these and other reasons I shall set out for London
to-morrow, having found by experience that the country
is not a place for a person of my temper, who does not
love jollity, and what they call "good neighbourhood." {25}
A man that is out of humour when an unexpected guest
breaks in upon him, and does not care for sacrificing an
afternoon to every chance comer; that will be the master
of his own time and the pursuer of his own inclinations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
makes but a very unsociable figure in this kind of life. I
shall therefore retire into the town, if I may make use of
that phrase, and get into the crowd again as fast as I can,
in order to be alone. I can there raise what speculations
I please upon others without being observed myself, and {<a href="#p173">5</a>}
at the same time enjoy all the advantages of company
with all the privileges of solitude. In the meanwhile, to
finish the month, and conclude these my rural speculations,
I shall here insert a letter from my friend Will
Honeycomb, who has not lived a month for these forty {10}
years out of the smoke of London, and rallies me after
his way upon my country life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Spec</span>,&mdash;I suppose this letter will find thee picking of
daisies, or smelling to a lock of hay, or passing away thy time in
some innocent country diversion of the like nature. I have, however, {15}
orders from the club to summon thee up to town, being all of
us cursedly afraid thou wilt not be able to relish our company after
thy conversations with Moll White and Will Wimble. Pr'ythee
don't send us up any more stories of a cock and a bull, nor frighten
the town with spirits and witches. Thy speculations begin to smell {20}
confoundedly of woods and meadows. If thou dost not come up
quickly, we shall conclude that thou art in love with one of Sir
Roger's dairy-maids. Service to the knight. Sir Andrew is grown
the cock of the club since he left us, and if he does not return
quickly will make every mother's son of us Commonwealth's men. {25}</p>

<p class="center">[No. 132. Wednesday, August 1, 1711. <span class="smcap">Steele.</span>]</p>

<blockquote>

</p></blockquote>


<p>Having notified to my good friend Sir Roger that I
should set out for London the next day, his horses were
ready at the appointed hour in the evening; and attended
by one of his grooms, I arrived at the county town at
twilight, in order to be ready for the stage-coach the day {<a href="#p174">5</a>}
following. As soon as we arrived at the inn, the servant
who waited upon me inquired of the chamberlain, in my
hearing, what company he had for the coach. The fellow
answered, "Mrs. Betty Arable, the great fortune, and the
widow, her mother; a recruiting officer,&mdash;who took a {10}
place because they were to go; young Squire Quickset,
her cousin,&mdash;that her mother wished her to be married
to; Ephraim, the Quaker, her guardian; and a gentleman
that had studied himself dumb from Sir Roger de
Coverley's." I observed, by what he said of myself, that {15}
according to his office, he dealt much in intelligence;
and doubted not but there was some foundation for his
reports of the rest of the company, as well as for the
whimsical account he gave of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak we were all called; and
I, who know my own natural shyness, and endeavour to
be as little liable to be disputed with as possible, dressed
immediately, that I might make no one wait. The first
preparation for our setting out was, that the captain's {5}
half-pike was placed near the coachman, and a drum
behind the coach. In the meantime the drummer, the
captain's equipage,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> was very loud that none of the captain's
things should be placed so as to be spoiled; upon
which his cloak bag was fixed in the seat<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of the coach; {10}
and the captain himself, according to a frequent though
invidious<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> behaviour of military men, ordered his man to
look sharp that none but one of the ladies should have
the place he had taken fronting to the coach-box.</p>

<p>We were in some little time fixed in our seats, and {15}
sat with that dislike which people not too good-natured
usually conceive of each other at first sight. The coach
jumbled us insensibly into some sort of familiarity, and
we had not moved above two miles when the widow asked
the captain what success he had in his recruiting. The {20}
officer, with a frankness he believed very graceful, told
her that indeed he had but very little luck, and had suffered
much by desertion, therefore should be glad to end
his warfare in the service of her or her fair daughter.
"In a word," continued he, "I am a soldier, and to be {25}
plain is my character; you see me, madam, young, sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and impudent; take me yourself, widow, or give me to
her; I will be wholly at your disposal. I am a soldier of
fortune, ha!" This was followed by a vain laugh of his
own, and a deep silence of all the rest of the company.
I had nothing left for it but to fall fast asleep, which I did {5}
with all speed. "Come," said he, "resolve upon it, we
will make a wedding at the next town: we will wake this
pleasant companion who has fallen asleep, to be the bride-man,
and,"&mdash;giving the Quaker a clap on the knee,&mdash;he
concluded, "this sly saint, who, I'll warrant, understands {10}
what's what as well as you or I, widow, shall give
the bride as father."</p>

<p>The Quaker, who happened to be a man of smartness,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
answered, "Friend, I take it in good part that thou hast
given me the authority of a father over this comely and {15}
virtuous child; and I must assure thee that if I have the
giving her, I shall not bestow her on thee. Thy mirth,
friend, savoureth of folly; thou art a person of a light
mind; thy drum is a type of thee,&mdash;it soundeth because
it is empty. Verily, it is not from thy fullness, but thy {20}
emptiness, that thou hast spoken this day. Friend, friend,
we have hired this coach in partnership with thee, to carry
us to the great city; we cannot go any other way. This
worthy mother must hear thee if thou wilt needs utter
thy follies; we cannot help it, friend, I say; if thou wilt, {25}
we must hear thee: but, if thou wert a man of understanding,
thou wouldst not take advantage of thy courageous
countenance to abash us children of peace. Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
art, thou sayest, a soldier; give quarter to us, who cannot
resist thee. Why didst thou fleer at our friend, who
feigned himself asleep? He said nothing, but how dost
thou know what he containeth? If thou speakest improper
things in the hearing of this virtuous young virgin, consider {<a href="#p177">5</a>}
it is an outrage against a distressed person that
cannot get from thee: to speak indiscreetly what we are
obliged to hear, by being hasped up with thee in this
public vehicle, is in some degree assaulting on the high
road." {10}</p>

<p>Here Ephraim paused, and the captain, with an happy
and uncommon impudence,&mdash;which can be convicted
and support itself at the same time,&mdash;cries, "Faith,
friend, I thank thee; I should have been a little impertinent
if thou hadst not reprimanded me. Come, thou {15}
art, I see, a smoky<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> old fellow, and I'll be very orderly
the ensuing part of the journey. I was going to give
myself airs; but, ladies, I beg pardon."</p>

<p>The captain was so little out of humour, and our company
was so far from being soured by this little ruffle, that {20}
Ephraim and he took a particular delight in being agreeable
to each other for the future, and assumed their different
provinces in the conduct of the company. Our
reckonings, apartments, and accommodation fell under<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Ephraim; and the captain looked to all disputes on the {25}
road,&mdash;as the good behaviour of our coachman, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
right we had of taking place as going to London of all
vehicles coming from thence.</p>

<p>The occurrences we met with were ordinary, and very
little happened which could entertain by the relation of
them; but when I considered the company we were in, I {5}
took it for no small good fortune that the whole journey
was not spent in impertinences, which to one part of us
might be an entertainment, to the other a suffering.</p>

<p>What, therefore, Ephraim said when we were almost
arrived at London, had to me an air not only of good {10}
understanding, but good breeding. Upon the young
lady's expressing her satisfaction in the journey, and
declaring how delightful it had been to her, Ephraim
delivered himself as follows: "There is no ordinary part
of human life which expresseth so much a good mind, {15}
and a right inward<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> man, as his behaviour upon meeting
with strangers, especially such as may seem the most
unsuitable companions to him: such a man, when he
falleth in the way with persons of simplicity and innocence,
however knowing he may be in the ways of men, {20}
will not vaunt himself thereof; but will the rather hide
his superiority to them, that he may not be painful unto
them. My good friend," continued he, turning to the
officer, "thee and I are to part by and by,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and peradventure
we may never meet again; but be advised by a {25}
plain man; modes and apparel are but trifles to the real
man, therefore do not think such a man as thyself terrible
for thy garb, nor such a one as me contemptible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
mine. When two such as thee and I meet, with affections
as we ought to have towards each other, thou
shouldst rejoice to see my peaceable demeanour, and I
should be glad to see thy strength and ability to protect
me in it."  {<a href="#p179">5</a>}</p>

<h2><a name="XXVI_SIR_ROGER_AND_SIR_ANDREW_IN" id="XXVI_SIR_ROGER_AND_SIR_ANDREW_IN">XXVI. SIR ROGER AND SIR ANDREW IN
ARGUMENT</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 174. Wednesday, Sept. 19, 1711. <span class="smcap">Steele.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Haec memini et victum frustra contendere Thyrsin.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>There is scarce anything more common than animosities
between parties that cannot subsist but by their
agreement: this was well represented in the sedition of
the members of the human body in the old Roman fable.
It is often the case of lesser confederate states against a {10}
superior power, which are hardly held together, though
their unanimity is necessary for their common safety; and
this is always the case of the landed and trading interest
of Great Britain: the trader is fed by the product of the
land, and the landed man cannot be clothed but by the {15}
skill of the trader; and yet those interests are ever
jarring.</p>

<p>We had last winter an instance of this at our club, in
Sir Roger de Coverley and Sir Andrew Freeport, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
whom there is generally a constant, though friendly, opposition
of opinions. It happened that one of the company,
in an historical discourse, was observing that Carthaginian
faith was a proverbial phrase to intimate breach of leagues.
Sir Roger said it "could hardly be otherwise; that the {<a href="#p180">5</a>}
Carthaginians were the greatest traders in the world, and
as gain is the chief end of such a people, they never
pursue any other,&mdash;the means to it are never regarded.
They will, if it comes easily, get money honestly; but if
not, they will not scruple to attain it by fraud, or cozenage. {10}
And, indeed, what is the whole business of the trader's
account, but to overreach him who trusts to his memory?
But were that not so, what can there great and noble be
expected from him whose attention is forever fixed upon
balancing his books, and watching over his expenses? {15}
And at best let frugality and parsimony be the virtues of
the merchant, how much is his punctual dealing below a
gentleman's charity to the poor, or hospitality among his
neighbours?"</p>

<p>Captain Sentry observed Sir Andrew very diligent in {20}
hearing Sir Roger, and had a mind to turn the discourse,
by taking notice, in general, from the highest to the lowest
parts of human society, there was "a secret though
unjust way among men of indulging the seeds of ill-nature
and envy by comparing their own state of life to that of {25}
another, and grudging the approach of their neighbour to
their own happiness: and on the other side, he who is the
less at his ease, repines at the other who, he thinks, has
unjustly the advantage over him. Thus the civil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
military lists look upon each other with much ill-nature:
the soldier repines at the courtier's power, and the courtier
rallies the soldier's honour; or, to come to lower
instances, the private men in the horse and foot of an
army, the carmen and coachmen in the city streets, mutually {5}
look upon each other with ill-will, when they are in
competition for quarters or the way, in their respective
motions."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>"It is very well, good captain," interrupted Sir Andrew;
"you may attempt to turn the discourse if you think fit; {10}
but I must, however, have a word or two with Sir Roger,
who, I see, thinks he has paid me off, and been very severe
upon the merchant. I shall not," continued he, "at this
time remind Sir Roger of the great and noble monuments
of charity and public spirit which have been erected by {15}
merchants since the Reformation, but at present content
myself with what he allows us,&mdash;parsimony and frugality.
If it were consistent with the quality of so ancient a baronet
as Sir Roger to keep an account, or measure things
by the most infallible way, that of numbers, he would {20}
prefer our parsimony to his hospitality. If to drink so
many hogsheads is to be hospitable, we do not contend
for the fame of that virtue; but it would be worth while
to consider whether so many artificers at work ten days
together by my appointment, or so many peasants made {25}
merry on Sir Roger's charge, are the men more obliged?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
I believe the families of the artificers<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> will thank me more
than the households of the peasants shall Sir Roger. Sir
Roger gives to his men, but I place mine above the necessity
or obligation of my bounty. I am in very little pain
for the Roman proverb upon the Carthaginian traders; the {5}
Romans were their professed enemies. I am only sorry
no Carthaginian histories have come to our hands; we
might have been taught, perhaps, by them some proverbs
against the Roman generosity, in fighting for and bestowing
other people's goods. But since Sir Roger has taken {10}
occasion from an old proverb to be out of humour with
merchants, it should be no offence to offer one not quite
so old in their defence. When a man happens to break<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
in Holland, they say of him that 'he has not kept true
accounts.' This phrase, perhaps, among us would appear {15}
a soft or humorous way of speaking; but with that exact
nation it bears the highest reproach. For a man to be
mistaken in the calculation of his expense, in his ability
to answer future demands, or to be impertinently<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> sanguine
in putting his credit to too great adventure, are all {20}
instances of as much infamy as, with gayer nations, to be
failing in courage or common honesty.</p>

<p>"Numbers are so much the measure of everything that
is valuable, that it is not possible to demonstrate the success
of any action, or the prudence of any undertaking, {25}
without them. I say this in answer to what Sir Roger
is pleased to say, that 'little that is truly noble can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
expected from one who is ever poring on his cashbook or
balancing his accounts.' When I have my returns from
abroad, I can tell to a shilling by the help of numbers the
profit or loss by my adventure; but I ought also to be
able to show that I had reason for making it, either from {<a href="#p183">5</a>}
my own experience or that of other people, or from a
reasonable presumption that my returns will be sufficient
to answer my expense and hazard: and this is never to be
done without the skill of numbers. For instance, if I am
to trade to Turkey, I ought beforehand to know the demand {10}
of our manufactures there, as well as of their silks
in England, and the customary prices that are given for
both in each country. I ought to have a clear knowledge
of these matters beforehand, that I may presume upon
sufficient returns to answer the charge of the cargo I have {15}
fitted out, the freight and assurance out and home, the
custom to the queen,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and the interest of my own money,
and besides all these expenses, a reasonable profit to
myself. Now what is there of scandal in this skill?
What has the merchant done that he should be so little {20}
in the good graces of Sir Roger? He throws down no
man's enclosure, and tramples upon no man's corn; he
takes nothing from the industrious labourer; he pays the
poor man for his work; he communicates<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> his profit with
mankind; by the preparation of his cargo, and the manufacture {25}
of his returns, he furnishes employment and subsistence
to greater numbers than the richest nobleman;
and even the nobleman is obliged to him for finding out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
foreign markets for the produce of his estate, and for
making a great addition to his rents:<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and yet it is certain
that none of all these things could be done by him
without the exercise of his skill in numbers.</p>

<p>"This is the economy of the merchant; and the conduct <a href="#p184">{5</a>}
of the gentleman must be the same, unless by
scorning to be the steward, he resolves the steward shall
be the gentleman. The gentleman, no more than the
merchant, is able, without the help of numbers, to account
for the success of any action, or the prudence of any {10}
adventure. If, for instance, the chase is his whole adventure,
his only returns must be the stag's horns in the
great hall and the fox's nose upon the stable door.
Without doubt Sir Roger knows the full value of these
returns; and if beforehand he had computed the charges {15}
of the chase, a gentleman of his discretion would certainly
have hanged up all his dogs; he would never have
brought back so many fine horses to the kennel; he
would never have gone so often, like a blast, over fields
of corn. If such, too, had been the conduct of all his {20}
ancestors, he might truly have boasted, at this day, that
the antiquity of his family had never been sullied by a
trade; a merchant had never been permitted with his
whole estate to purchase a room for his picture in the
gallery of the Coverley's, or to claim his descent from the {25}
maid of honour. But 'tis very happy for Sir Roger that
the merchant paid so dear for his ambition. 'Tis the
misfortune of many other gentlemen to turn out of<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
seats of their ancestors to make way for such new masters
as have been more exact in their accounts than themselves;
and certainly he deserves the estate a great deal
better who has got it by his industry, than he who has
lost it by his negligence." {<a href="#p185">5</a>}</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Ovid.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>I was this morning surprised with a great knocking at
the door, when my landlady's daughter came up to me
and told me that there was a man below desired to
speak with me. Upon my asking her who it was, she
told me it was a very grave, elderly person, but that she {10}
did not know his name. I immediately went down to
him, and found him to be the coachman of my worthy
friend, Sir Roger de Coverley. He told me that his master
came to town last night, and would be glad to take a turn
with me in Gray's Inn Walks. As I was wondering in {15}
myself what had brought Sir Roger to town, not having
lately received any letter from him, he told me that his
master was come up to get a sight of Prince Eugene,
and that he desired I would immediately meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>I was not a little pleased with the curiosity of the old
knight, though I did not much wonder at it, having heard
him say more than once in private discourse that he
looked upon Prince Eugenio&mdash;for so the knight always
calls him&mdash;to be a greater man than Scanderbeg. {<a href="#p186">5</a>}</p>

<p>I was no sooner come into Gray's Inn Walks, but I
heard my friend upon the terrace hemming twice or
thrice to himself with great vigour, for he loves to clear
his pipes in good air, to make use of his own phrase,
and is not a little pleased with any one who takes notice {10}
of the strength which he still exerts in his morning hems.</p>

<p>I was touched with a secret joy at the sight of the good
old man, who before he saw me was engaged in conversation
with a beggar-man that had asked an alms of him.
I could hear my friend chide him for not finding out {15}
some work; but at the same time saw him put his hand
in his pocket and give him sixpence.</p>

<p>Our salutations were very hearty on both sides, consisting
of many kind shakes of the hand, and several affectionate
looks which we cast upon one another. After {20}
which the knight told me my good friend his chaplain
was very well, and much at my service, and that the
Sunday before he had made a most incomparable sermon
out of Doctor Barrow. "I have left," says he, "all my
affairs in his hands, and being willing to lay an obligation {25}
upon him, have deposited with him thirty marks, to be
distributed among his poor parishioners."</p>

<p>He then proceeded to acquaint me with the welfare of
Will Wimble. Upon which he put his hand into his fob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and presented me, in his name, with a tobacco stopper,
telling me that Will had been busy all the beginning of
the winter in turning great quantities of them, and that
he made a present of one to every gentleman in the
country who has good principles and smokes. He added {<a href="#p187">5</a>}
that poor Will was at present under great tribulation, for
that Tom Touchy had taken the law of him for cutting
some hazel sticks out of one of his hedges.</p>

<p>Among other pieces of news which the knight brought
from his country-seat, he informed me that Moll White {10}
was dead; and that about a month after her death the
wind was so very high that it blew down the end of one
of his barns. "But for my own part," says Sir Roger,
"I do not think that the old woman had any hand in
it." {15}</p>

<p>He afterwards fell into an account of the diversions
which had passed in his house during the holidays; for
Sir Roger, after the laudable custom of his ancestors,
always keeps open house at Christmas. I learned from
him that he had killed eight fat hogs for this season, that {20}
he had dealt about his chines very liberally amongst his
neighbours, and that in particular he had sent a string of
hog's-puddings<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> with a pack of cards to every poor family
in the parish. "I have often thought," says Sir Roger,
"it happens very well that Christmas should fall out in {25}
the middle of the winter. It is the most dead, uncomfortable
time of the year, when the poor people would
suffer very much from their poverty and cold if they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
not good cheer, warm fires, and Christmas gambols to
support them. I love to rejoice their poor hearts at this
season, and to see the whole village merry in my great
hall. I allow a double quantity of malt to my small beer,
and set it a running for twelve days to every one that calls {<a href="#p188">5</a>}
for it. I have always a piece of cold beef and a mince-pie
upon the table, and am wonderfully pleased to see my
tenants pass away a whole evening in playing their innocent
tricks, and smutting one another. Our friend Will
Wimble is as merry as any of them, and shows a thousand {10}
roguish tricks upon these occasions."</p>

<p>I was very much delighted with the reflection of my old
friend, which carried so much goodness in it. He then
launched out into the praise of the late Act of Parliament
for securing the Church of England, and told me, {15}
with great satisfaction, that he believed it already began
to take effect, for that a rigid Dissenter, who chanced to
dine at his house on Christmas day, had been observed to
eat very plentifully of his plum-porridge.</p>

<p>After having dispatched all our country matters, Sir {20}
Roger made several inquiries concerning the club, and
particularly of his old antagonist, Sir Andrew Freeport.
He asked me with a kind of smile whether Sir Andrew
had not taken advantage of his absence to vent among
them some of his republican doctrines; but soon after, {25}
gathering up his countenance into a more than ordinary
seriousness, "Tell me truly," says he, "don't you think
Sir Andrew had a hand in the Pope's Procession?" But
without giving me time to answer him, "Well, well," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
he, "I know you are a wary man, and do not care to talk
of public matters."</p>

<p>The knight then asked me if I had seen Prince Eugenio,
and made me promise to get him a stand in some convenient
place, where he might have a full sight of that {<a href="#p189">5</a>}
extraordinary man, whose presence does so much honour
to the British nation. He dwelt very long on the praises
of this great general, and I found that, since I was with
him in the country, he had drawn many observations
together out of his reading in Baker's <cite>Chronicle</cite>, and {10}
other authors who always lie in his hall window, which
very much redound to the honour of this prince.</p>

<p>Having passed away the greatest part of the morning
in hearing the knight's reflections,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> which were partly
private and partly political, he asked me if I would smoke {15}
a pipe with him over a dish of coffee at Squire's. As I
love the old man, I take delight in complying with everything
that is agreeable to him, and accordingly waited on
him to the coffee-house, where his venerable figure drew
upon us the eyes of the whole room. He had no sooner {20}
seated himself at the upper end of the high table, but he
called for a clean pipe, a paper of tobacco, a dish of
coffee, a wax candle, and the <cite>Supplement</cite>, with such an
air of cheerfulness and good humour that all the boys in
the coffee-room&mdash;who seemed to take pleasure in serving {25}
him&mdash;were at once employed on his several errands;
insomuch that nobody else could come at a dish of tea
till the knight had got all his conveniences about him.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVIII_SIR_ROGER_IN_WESTMINSTER_ABBEY" id="XXVIII_SIR_ROGER_IN_WESTMINSTER_ABBEY">XXVIII. SIR ROGER IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 329. Tuesday, March 18, 1712. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Ire tamen restat Numa quo devenit et Ancus.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="ir"><span class="smcap">Hor.</span></span></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>My friend Sir Roger de Coverley told me t'other night,
that he had been reading my paper upon Westminster
Abbey, "in which," says he, "there are a great many
ingenious fancies." He told me, at the same time, that
he observed I had promised another paper upon the {<a href="#p190">5</a>}
tombs, and that he should be glad to go and see them
with me, not having visited them since he had read history.
I could not at first imagine how this came into the
knight's head, till I recollected that he had been very
busy all last summer upon Baker's <cite>Chronicle</cite> which he {10}
has quoted several times in his disputes with Sir Andrew
Freeport since his last coming to town. Accordingly,
I promised to call upon him the next morning, that we
might go together to the Abbey.</p>

<p>I found the knight under his butler's hands, who {15}
always shaves him. He was no sooner dressed than he
called for a glass of the Widow Trueby's water, which
he told me he always drank before he went abroad. He
recommended me to a dram of it at the same time with
so much heartiness that I could not forbear drinking it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> {20}
As soon as I had got it down, I found it very unpalatable;
upon which the knight, observing that I had made several
wry faces, told me that he knew I should not like it at
first, but that it was the best thing in the world against
the stone or gravel. I could have wished, indeed, that {<a href="#p191">5</a>}
he had acquainted me with the virtues of it sooner; but
it was too late to complain, and I knew what he had
done was out of good-will. Sir Roger told me, further,
that he looked upon it to be very good for a man, whilst
he stayed in town, to keep off infection; and that he got {10}
together a quantity of it upon the first news of the sickness
being at Dantzic. When, of a sudden, turning short
to one of his servants, who stood behind him, he bid him
call a hackney-coach, and take care it was an elderly man
that drove it. {15}</p>

<p>He then resumed his discourse upon Mrs. Trueby's
water, telling me that the Widow Trueby was one who
did more good than all the doctors and apothecaries in
the county; that she distilled every poppy that grew
within five miles of her; that she distributed her water {20}
gratis among all sorts of people: to which the knight
added that she had a very great jointure, and that the
whole country would fain have it a match between him
and her; "And truly," said Sir Roger, "if I had not
been engaged,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> perhaps I could not have done better." {25}</p>

<p>His discourse was broken off by his man's telling him
he had called a coach. Upon our going to it, after having
cast his eye upon the wheels, he asked the coachman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
if his axle-tree was good; upon the fellow's telling him
he would warrant it, the knight turned to me, told me he
looked like an honest man, and went in without further
ceremony.</p>

<p>We had not gone far, when Sir Roger, popping out his {<a href="#p192">5</a>}
head, called the coachman down from his box, and upon
his presenting himself at the window, asked him if he
smoked; as I was considering what this would end in,
he bid him stop by the way at any good tobacconist's,
and take in a roll of their best Virginia. Nothing material {10}
happened in the remaining part of our journey till we
were set down at the west end of the Abbey.</p>

<p>As we went up the body of the church, the knight
pointed at the trophies upon one of the new monuments,
and cried out, "A brave man, I warrant him!" Passing {15}
afterwards by Sir Cloudesley Shovel, he flung his hand
that way, and cried, "Sir Cloudesley Shovel! a very gallant
man!" As we stood before Busby's tomb, the knight
uttered himself again after the same manner: "Dr. Busby&mdash;a
great man! he whipped my grandfather&mdash;a very {20}
great man! I should have gone to him myself if I had
not been a blockhead;&mdash;a very great man!"</p>

<p>We were immediately conducted into the little chapel
on the right hand. Sir Roger, planting himself at our
historian's<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> elbow, was very attentive to everything he {25}
said, particularly to the account he gave us of the lord
who had cut off the King of Morocco's head. Among
several other figures, he was very well pleased to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
statesman Cecil upon his knees; and, concluding them
all to be great men, was conducted to the figure which
represents that martyr to good housewifery who died by
the prick of a needle. Upon our interpreter's telling us
that she was a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth, the {<a href="#p193">5</a>}
knight was very inquisitive into her name and family; and
after having regarded her finger for some time, "I wonder,"
says he, "that Sir Richard Baker has said nothing
of her in his <cite>Chronicle</cite>."</p>

<p>We were then conveyed to the two coronation chairs, {10}
where my old friend, after having heard that the stone
underneath the most ancient of them, which was brought
from Scotland, was called Jacob's Pillar, sat himself down
in the chair, and looking like the figure of an old Gothic
king, asked our interpreter what authority they had to say {15}
that Jacob had ever been in Scotland. The fellow, instead
of returning him an answer, told him that he hoped his
honour would pay his forfeit.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> I could observe Sir Roger
a little ruffled upon being thus trepanned;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> but, our guide
not insisting upon his demand, the knight soon recovered {20}
his good humour, and whispered in my ear that if Will
Wimble were with us, and saw those two chairs, it would
go hard but he would get a tobacco-stopper out of one or
t'other of them.</p>

<p>Sir Roger, in the next place, laid his hand upon Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> {25}
the Third's sword, and leaning upon the pommel of it,
gave us the whole history of the Black Prince; concluding
that, in Sir Richard Baker's opinion, Edward the Third
was one of the greatest princes that ever sat upon the
English throne. {<a href="#p194">5</a>}</p>

<p>We were then shown Edward the Confessor's tomb, upon
which Sir Roger acquainted us that he was the first who
touched for the evil; and afterwards Henry the Fourth's,
upon which he shook his head and told us there was fine
reading in the casualties of that reign. {10}</p>

<p>Our conductor then pointed to that monument where
there is the figure of one of our English kings without an
head; and upon giving us to know that the head, which
was of beaten silver, had been stolen away several years
since,&mdash;"Some Whig, I'll warrant you," says Sir Roger; {15}
"you ought to lock up your kings better; they will carry
off the body too, if you don't take care."</p>

<p>The glorious names of Henry the Fifth and Queen
Elizabeth gave the knight great opportunities of shining
and of doing justice to Sir Richard Baker, who, as our {20}
knight observed with some surprise, had a great many
kings in him whose monuments he had not seen in the
Abbey.</p>

<p>For my own part, I could not but be pleased to see the
knight show such an honest passion for the glory of his {25}
country, and such a respectful gratitude to the memory
of its princes.</p>

<p>I must not omit that the benevolence of my good old
friend, which flows out towards every one he converses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
with, made him very kind to our interpreter, whom he
looked upon as an extraordinary man; for which reason
his shook him by the hand at parting, telling him that he
should be very glad to see him at his lodgings in Norfolk
Buildings, and talk over these matters with him more at {<a href="#p195">5</a>}
leisure.</p>

<p>My friend Sir Roger de Coverley, when we last met
together at the club, told me that he had a great mind to
see the new tragedy with me, assuring me at the same
time that he had not been at a play these twenty years. {10}
"The last I saw," said Sir Roger, "was the <em>Committee</em>,
which I should not have gone to, neither, had not I been
told beforehand that it was a good Church of England
comedy." He then proceeded to inquire of me who this
distressed mother was; and upon hearing that she was {15}
Hector's widow, he told me that her husband was a brave
man, and that when he was a schoolboy he had read his
life at the end of the dictionary. My friend asked me,
in the next place, if there would not be some danger in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
coming home late, in case the Mohocks should be abroad.
"I assure you," says he, "I thought I had fallen into their
hands last night, for I observed two or three lusty black<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
men that followed me half way up Fleet Street, and
mended their pace behind me in proportion as I put on {<a href="#p196">5</a>}
to get away from them. You must know," continued the
knight, with a smile, "I fancied they had a mind to <em>hunt</em>
me, for I remember an honest gentleman in my neighbourhood
who was served such a trick in King Charles the
Second's time; for which reason he has not ventured himself {10}
in town ever since. I might have shown them very
good sport had this been their design; for, as I am an old
fox-hunter, I should have turned and dodged, and have
played them a thousand tricks they had never seen in
their lives before." Sir Roger added that if these gentlemen {15}
had any such intention they did not succeed very
well in it; "for I threw them out," says he, "at the end
of Norfolk Street, where I doubled the corner and got
shelter in my lodgings before they could imagine what
was become of me. However," says the knight, "if Captain {20}
Sentry will make one with us to-morrow night, and
if you will both of you call upon me about four o'clock,
that we may be at the house before it is full, I will have
my own coach in readiness to attend you, for John tells
me he has got the fore wheels mended." {25}</p>

<p>The captain, who did not fail to meet me there at the
appointed hour, bid Sir Roger fear nothing, for that he
had put on the same sword which he made use of at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
battle of Steenkirk. Sir Roger's servants, and among
the rest my old friend the butler, had, I found, provided
themselves with good oaken plants<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> to attend their master
upon this occasion. When he had placed him in his
coach, with myself at his left hand, the captain before {<a href="#p197">5</a>}
him, and his butler at the head of his footmen in the
rear, we convoyed him in safety to the playhouse, where,
after having marched up the entry in good order, the
captain and I went in with him, and seated him betwixt
us in the pit. As soon as the house was full and the {10}
candles lighted, my old friend stood up and looked about
him with that pleasure which a mind seasoned with humanity
naturally feels in itself at the sight of a multitude
of people who seem pleased with one another, and partake
of the same common entertainment. I could not {15}
but fancy to myself, as the old man stood up in the middle
of the pit, that he made a very proper centre to a
tragic audience. Upon the entering of Pyrrhus, the
knight told me that he did not believe the King of
France himself had a better strut. I was, indeed, very {20}
attentive to my old friend's remarks, because I looked
upon them as a piece of natural criticism; and was well
pleased to hear him, at the conclusion of almost every
scene, telling me that he could not imagine how the play
would end. One while he appeared much concerned for {25}
Andromache, and a little while after as much for Hermione;
and was extremely puzzled to think what would
become of Pyrrhus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>When Sir Roger saw Andromache's obstinate refusal
to her lover's importunities, he whispered me in the ear,
that he was sure she would never have him; to which he
added, with a more than ordinary vehemence, "You
can't imagine, sir, what 'tis to have to do with a widow!" {<a href="#p198">5</a>}
Upon Pyrrhus his<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> threatening afterwards to leave her,
the knight shook his head, and muttered to himself,
"Ay, do if you can." This part dwelt so much upon
my friend's imagination, that at the close of the third
act, as I was thinking of something else, he whispered {10}
in my ear, "These widows, sir, are the most perverse
creatures in the world. But pray," says he, "you that
are a critic, is the play according to your dramatic
rules, as you call them? Should your people in tragedy
always talk to be understood? Why, there is not a {15}
single sentence in this play that I do not know the
meaning of."</p>

<p>The fourth act very luckily begun before I had time to
give the old gentleman an answer. "Well," says the
knight, sitting down with great satisfaction, "I suppose {20}
we are now to see Hector's ghost." He then renewed
his attention, and, from time to time, fell a praising the
widow. He made, indeed, a little mistake as to one of
her pages, whom at his first entering he took for Astyanax;
but he quickly set himself right in that particular, {25}
though at the same time he owned he should have been
very glad to have seen the little boy, "who," says he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
"must needs be a very fine child by the account that is
given of him."</p>

<p>Upon Hermione's going off with a menace to Pyrrhus,
the audience gave a loud clap, to which Sir Roger added,
"On my word, a notable young baggage!" {<a href="#p199">5</a>}</p>

<p>As there was a very remarkable silence and stillness in
the audience during the whole action, it was natural for
them to take the opportunity of these intervals between
the acts to express their opinion of the players and of
their respective parts. Sir Roger, hearing a cluster of {10}
them praise Orestes, struck in with them, and told them
that he thought his friend Pylades was a very sensible
man; as they were afterwards applauding Pyrrhus, Sir
Roger put in a second time: "And let me tell you,"
says he, "though he speaks but little, I like the old fellow {15}
in whiskers as well as any of them." Captain Sentry,
seeing two or three wags who sat near us lean with an
attentive ear towards Sir Roger, and fearing lest they
should smoke<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the knight, plucked him by the elbow,
and whispered something in his ear that lasted till the {20}
opening of the fifth act. The knight was wonderfully
attentive to the account which Orestes gives of Pyrrhus
his death, and, at the conclusion of it, told me it was such
a bloody piece of work that he was glad it was not done
upon the stage. Seeing afterwards Orestes in his raving {25}
fit, he grew more than ordinary serious, and took occasion
to moralize, in his way, upon an evil conscience, adding
that Orestes in his madness looked as if he saw something.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>As we were the first that came into the house, so we
were the last that went out of it; being resolved to have
a clear passage for our old friend, whom we did not care
to venture among the justling of the crowd. Sir Roger
went out fully satisfied with his entertainment, and we {5}
guarded him to his lodgings in the same manner that we
brought him to the playhouse; being highly pleased, for
my own part, not only with the performance of the
excellent piece which had been presented, but with the
satisfaction which it had given to the good old man. {10}</p>

<p>As we were at the club last night, I observed that my
friend Sir Roger, contrary to his usual custom, sat very
silent, and instead of minding what was said by the company,
was whistling to himself in a very thoughtful mood,
and playing with a cork. I jogged Sir Andrew Freeport {15}
who sat between us; and as we were both observing him,
we saw the knight shake his head and heard him say to
himself, "A foolish woman! I can't believe it." Sir
Andrew gave him a gentle pat upon the shoulder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
offered to lay him a bottle of wine that he was thinking
of the widow. My old friend started, and, recovering
out of his brown study, told Sir Andrew that once in his
life he had been in the right. In short, after some little
hesitation, Sir Roger told us, in the fullness of his heart, {5}
that he had just received a letter from his steward, which
acquainted him that his old rival and antagonist in the
county, Sir David Dundrum, had been making a visit to
the widow. "However," says Sir Roger, "I can never
think that she'll have a man that's half a year older than {10}
I am, and a noted Republican into the bargain."</p>

<p>Will Honeycomb, who looks upon love as his particular
province, interrupting our friend with a jaunty laugh, "I
thought, knight," says he, "thou hadst lived long enough
in the world not to pin thy happiness upon one that is a {15}
woman and a widow. I think that without vanity I may
pretend to know as much of the female world as any man
in Great Britain, though the chief of my knowledge consists
in this,&mdash;that they are not to be known." Will
immediately, with his usual fluency, rambled into an {20}
account of his own amours. "I am now," says he,
"upon the verge of fifty" (though, by the way, we all
knew he was turned of threescore). "You may easily
guess," continued Will, "that I have not lived so long in
the world without having had some thoughts of settling {25}
in it, as the phrase is. To tell you truly, I have several
times tried my fortune that way, though I can't much
boast of my success.</p>

<p>"I made my first addresses to a young lady in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
country; but when I thought things were pretty well
drawing to a conclusion, her father happening to hear
that I had formerly boarded with a surgeon, the old put<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
forbid me his house, and within a fortnight after married
his daughter to a fox hunter in the neighbourhood. {<a href="#p202">5</a>}</p>

<p>"I made my next applications to a widow, and attacked
her so briskly that I thought myself within a fortnight of
her. As I waited upon her one morning, she told me
that she intended to keep her ready money and jointure<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
in her own hand, and desired me to call upon her attorney {10}
in Lyon's Inn, who would adjust with me what it was
proper for me to add to it. I was so rebuffed by this
overture that I never inquired either for her or her
attorney afterwards.</p>

<p>"A few months after, I addressed myself to a young {15}
lady who was an only daughter and of a good family; I
danced with her at several balls, squeezed her by the
hand, said soft things, and, in short, made no doubt
of her heart; and, though my fortune was not equal
to hers, I was in hopes that her fond father would not {20}
deny her the man she had fixed her affections upon.
But, as I went one day to the house in order to break the
matter to him, I found the whole family in confusion, and
heard, to my unspeakable surprise, that Miss Jenny was
that very morning run away with the butler. {25}</p>

<p>"I then courted a second widow, and am at a loss to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
this day how I came to miss her, for she had often commended
my person and behaviour. Her maid, indeed,
told me one day that her mistress had said she never
saw a gentleman with such a spindle pair of legs as Mr.
Honeycomb. {<a href="#p203">5</a>}</p>

<p>"After this I laid siege to four heiresses successively,
and being a handsome young dog in those days, quickly
made a breach in their hearts; but I don't know how it
came to pass, though I seldom failed of getting the daughter's
consent, I could never in my life get the old people {10}
on my side.</p>

<p>"I could give you an account of a thousand other unsuccessful
attempts, particularly of one which I made some
years since upon an old woman, whom I had certainly
borne away with flying colours if her relations had not come {15}
pouring in to her assistance from all parts of England;
nay, I believe I should have got her at last, had not she
been carried off by an hard frost."</p>

<p>As Will's transitions are extremely quick, he turned
from Sir Roger, and applying himself to me, told me {20}
there was a passage in the book I had considered last
Saturday which deserved to be writ in letters of gold;
and taking out a pocket Milton, read the following lines,
which are part of one of Adam's speeches to Eve after
the fall: {25}</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Sir Roger listened to this passage with great attention,
and desiring Mr. Honeycomb to fold down a leaf at the
place and lend him his book, the knight put it up in his
pocket, and told us that he would read over those verses {20}
again before he went to bed.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXI_SIR_ROGER_AT_VAUXHALL" id="XXXI_SIR_ROGER_AT_VAUXHALL">XXXI. SIR ROGER AT VAUXHALL</a></h2>

<p class="center">[No. 383. Tuesday, May 20, 1712. <span class="smcap">Addison.</span>]</p>

</div></div></div>


<p>As I was sitting in my chamber and thinking on a subject
for my next <cite>Spectator</cite>, I heard two or three irregular
bounces at my landlady's door, and upon the opening of
it, a loud, cheerful voice inquiring whether the philosopher
was at home. The child who went to the door {<a href="#p205">5</a>}
answered very innocently that he did not lodge there. I
immediately recollected that it was my good friend Sir
Roger's voice, and that I had promised to go with him
on the water to Spring Garden, in case it proved a good
evening. The knight put me in mind of my promise {10}
from the bottom of the staircase, but told me that if I
was speculating he would stay below till I had done.
Upon my coming down, I found all the children of the
family got about my old friend, and my landlady herself
who is a notable prating gossip, engaged in a conference {15}
with him, being mightily pleased with his stroking her
little boy upon the head, and bidding him be a good
child and mind his book.</p>

<p>We were no sooner come to the Temple Stairs but we
were surrounded with a crowd of watermen, offering us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> {20}
their respective services. Sir Roger, after having looked
about him very attentively, spied one with a wooden leg,
and immediately gave him orders to get his boat ready.
As we were walking towards it, "You must know," says
Sir Roger, "I never make use of anybody to row me that {<a href="#p206">5</a>}
has not either lost a leg or an arm. I would rather bate
him a few strokes of his oar than not employ an honest
man that had been wounded in the Queen's service. If
I was a lord or a bishop, and kept a barge, I would not
put a fellow in my livery that had not a wooden leg." {10}</p>

<p>My old friend, after having seated himself and trimmed
the boat with his coachman,&mdash;who, being a very sober
man, always serves for ballast on these occasions,&mdash;we
made the best of our way for Fox-hall. Sir Roger obliged
the waterman to give us the history of his right leg, and {15}
hearing that he had left it at La Hogue, with many particulars
which passed in that glorious action, the knight,
in the triumph of his heart, made several reflections on
the greatness of the British nation; as, that one Englishman
could beat three Frenchmen; that we could never {20}
be in danger of popery so long as we took care of our
fleet; that the Thames was the noblest river in Europe;
that London Bridge was a greater piece of work than any
of the seven wonders of the world; with many other
honest prejudices which naturally cleave to the heart of a {25}
true Englishman.</p>

<p>After some short pause, the old knight, turning about
his head twice or thrice to take a survey of this great
metropolis, bid me observe how thick the city was set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
with churches, and that there was scarce a single steeple
on this side Temple Bar. "A most heathenish sight!"
says Sir Roger; "there is no religion at this end of the
town. The fifty new churches will very much mend the
prospect; but church work is slow, church work is {<a href="#p207">5</a>}
slow!"</p>

<p>I do not remember I have anywhere mentioned, in Sir
Roger's character, his custom of saluting everybody that
passes by him with a good-morrow or a good-night. This
the old man does out of the overflowings of his humanity, {10}
though at the same time it renders him so popular among
all his country neighbours that it is thought to have gone
a good way in making him once or twice knight of the
shire.</p>

<p>He cannot forbear this exercise of benevolence even in {15}
town, when he meets with any one in his morning or evening
walk. It broke from him to several boats that passed
by us upon the water; but to the knight's great surprise,
as he gave the good-night to two or three young fellows a
little before our landing, one of them, instead of returning {20}
the civility, asked us what queer old put we had in
the boat, ... with a great deal of the like Thames
ribaldry. Sir Roger seemed a little shocked at first, but
at length, assuming a face of magistracy, told us that if
he were a Middlesex justice he would make such vagrants {25}
know that her Majesty's subjects were no more to be
abused by water than by land.</p>

<p>We were now arrived at Spring Garden, which is exquisitely
pleasant at this time of year. When I considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the fragrancy of the walks and bowers, with the choirs
of birds that sung upon the trees, and the loose tribe of
people that walked under their shades, I could not but
look upon the place as a kind of Mahometan paradise.
Sir Roger told me it put him in mind of a little coppice {<a href="#p208">5</a>}
by his house in the country, which his chaplain used to call
an aviary of nightingales. "You must understand," says
the knight, "there is nothing in the world that pleases a
man in love so much as your nightingale. Ah, Mr. Spectator!
the many moonlight nights that I have walked by {10}
myself and thought on the widow by the music of the
nightingales!" He here fetched a deep sigh, and was
falling into a fit of musing, when a mask,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> who came
behind him, gave him a gentle tap upon the shoulder, and
asked him if he would drink a bottle of mead with her. {15}
But the knight, being startled at so unexpected a familiarity,
and displeased to be interrupted in his thoughts of the
widow, told her she was a wanton baggage, and bid her
go about her business.</p>

<p>We concluded our walk with a glass of Burton ale and {20}
a slice of hung beef. When we had done eating, ourselves,
the knight called a waiter to him and bid him carry
the remainder to the waterman that had but one leg. I
perceived the fellow stared upon him at the oddness of
the message, and was going to be saucy; upon which I {25}
ratified the knight's commands with a peremptory look.</p>

<p>As we were going out of the garden, my old friend,
thinking himself obliged as a member of the quorum to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
animadvert upon the morals of the place, told the mistress
of the house, who sat at the bar, that he should be a better
customer to her garden if there were more nightingales
and fewer strumpets.</p>

<p>We last night received a piece of ill news at our club {5}
which very sensibly afflicted every one of us. I question
not but my readers themselves will be troubled at the
hearing of it. To keep them no longer in suspense,&mdash;Sir
Roger de Coverley <em>is dead</em>. He departed this life at his
house in the country, after a few weeks' sickness. Sir {10}
Andrew Freeport has a letter from one of his correspondents
in those parts, that informs him the old man caught
a cold at the county sessions, as he was very warmly
promoting an address of his own penning, in which he
succeeded according to his wishes. But this particular {15}
comes from a Whig justice of peace, who was always Sir
Roger's enemy and antagonist. I have letters both from
the chaplain and Captain Sentry which mention nothing
of it, but are filled with many particulars to the honour of
the good old man. I have likewise a letter from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> {20}
butler, who took so much care of me last summer when
I was at the knight's house. As my friend the butler
mentions, in the simplicity of his heart, several circumstances
the others have passed over in silence, I shall
give my reader a copy of his letter without any alteration {5}
or diminution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Honoured Sir,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knowing that you was my old master's good friend, I could
not forbear sending you the melancholy news of his death, which
has afflicted the whole country, as well as his poor servants, who {10}
loved him, I may say, better than we did our lives. I am afraid
he caught his death the last county sessions, where he would go
to see justice done to a poor widow woman, and her fatherless
children, that had been wronged by a neighbouring gentleman; for
you know, sir, my good master was always the poor man's friend. {15}
Upon his coming home, the first complaint he made was, that he
had lost his roast beef stomach, not being able to touch a sirloin,
which was served up according to custom; and you know he used
to take great delight in it. From that time forward he grew worse
and worse, but still kept a good heart<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> to the last. Indeed, we {20}
were once in great hope of his recovery, upon a kind message that
was sent him from the widow lady whom he had made love to the
forty last years of his life; but this only proved a light'ning before
death. He has bequeathed to this lady, as a token of his love, a
great pearl necklace, and a couple of silver bracelets set with jewels, {25}
which belonged to my good old lady his mother. He has bequeathed
the fine white gelding, that he used to ride a hunting
upon, to his chaplain, because he thought he would be kind to him,
and has left you all his books. He has, moreover, bequeathed to
the chaplain a very pretty tenement with good lands about it. It {30}
being a very cold day when he made his will, he left for mourning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to every man in the parish, a great frieze coat, and to every woman
a black riding-hood. It was a most moving sight to see him take
leave of his poor servants, commending us all for our fidelity, whilst
we were not able to speak a word for weeping. As we most of us
are grown gray-headed in our dear master's service, he has left us {<a href="#p211">5</a>}
pensions and legacies, which we may live very comfortably upon,
the remaining part of our days. He has bequeath'd a great deal
more in charity, which is not yet come to my knowledge, and it is
peremptorily said in the parish, that he has left money to build a
steeple to the church; for he was heard to say some time ago, that {10}
if he lived two years longer, Coverley Church should have a steeple
to it. The chaplain tells everybody that he made a very good end,
and never speaks of him without tears. He was buried according
to his own directions, among the family of the Coverley's, on the
left hand of his father, Sir Arthur. The coffin was carried by six of {15}
his tenants, and the pall held up by six of the quorum. The whole
parish follow'd the corpse with heavy hearts, and in their mourning
suits, the men in frieze, and the women in riding-hoods. Captain
Sentry, my master's nephew, has taken possession of the hall
house, and the whole estate. When my old master saw him a {20}
little before his death, he shook him by the hand, and wished him
joy of the estate which was falling to him, desiring him only to
make good use of it, and to pay the several legacies, and the gifts
of charity which he told him he had left as quitrents upon the
estate. The captain truly seems a courteous man, though he says {25}
but little. He makes much of those whom my master loved, and
shows great kindness to the old house dog, that you know my poor
master was so fond of. It would have gone to your heart to have
heard the moans the dumb creature made on the day of my master's
death. He has ne'er joyed himself since; no more has any {30}
of us. 'Twas the melancholiest day for the poor people that ever
happened in Worcestershire. This being all from,</p>

"Edward Biscuit."      {35}</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"P. S. My master desired, some weeks before he died, that a
book which comes up to you by the carrier should be given to Sir
Andrew Freeport, in his name."</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter, notwithstanding the poor butler's manner
of writing it, gave us such an idea of our good old friend, {<a href="#p212">5</a>}
that upon the reading of it there was not a dry eye in
the club. Sir Andrew, opening the book, found it to be
a collection of Acts of Parliament. There was in particular
the Act of Uniformity, with some passages in it
marked by Sir Roger's own hand. Sir Andrew found {10}
that they related to two or three points which he had
disputed with Sir Roger the last time he appeared at the
club. Sir Andrew, who would have been merry at such
an incident on another occasion, at the sight of the old
man's handwriting burst into tears, and put the book {15}
into his pocket. Captain Sentry informs me that the
knight has left rings and mourning for every one in the
club.</p>

<p>There are, I think, sentiments in the following letter
from my friend Captain Sentry, which discover a rational
and equal frame of mind, as well prepared for an advantageous
as an unfortunate change of condition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">

"Coverley Hall, Nov. 15,      {5}<br />
"Worcestershire. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
"Sir,
</p>

<p>"I am come to the succession of the estate of my honoured
kinsman, Sir Roger de Coverley; and I assure you I find it no
easy task to keep up the figure of master of the fortune which {10}
was so handsomely enjoyed by that honest, plain man. I cannot
(with respect to the great obligations I have, be it spoken) reflect
upon his character, but I am confirmed in the truth which I have,
I think, heard spoken at the club; to wit, that a man of a warm
and well-disposed heart, with a very small capacity, is highly {15}
superior in human society to him who, with the greatest talents,
is cold and languid in his affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, alas! why do I make a difficulty in speaking of my worthy
ancestor's failings? His little absurdities and incapacity for the
conversation<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> of the politest men are dead with him, and his
greater qualities are even now useful to him. I know not whether
by naming those disabilities I do not enhance his merit, since he {5}
has left behind him a reputation in his country which would be
worth the pains of the wisest man's whole life to arrive at.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"But, indeed, my chief business at this time is to represent to
you my present state of mind, and the satisfactions I promise to
myself in the possession of my new fortune. I have continued all {10}
Sir Roger's servants, except such as it was a relief to dismiss into
little beings<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> within my manor. Those who are in a list of the
good knight's own hand to be taken care of by me, I have quartered
upon such as have taken new leases of me, and added so
many advantages during the lives of the persons so quartered, that {15}
it is the interest of those whom they are joined with, to cherish
and befriend them upon all occasions.</p>

<p>"I find a considerable sum of ready money, which I am laying
out among my dependants at the common interest, but with a
design to lend it according to their merit, rather than according {20}
to their ability. I shall lay a tax upon such as I have highly
obliged, to become security to me for such of their own poor youth,
whether male or female, as want help towards getting into some
being in the world.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> I hope I shall be able to manage my affairs
so as to improve my fortune every year by doing acts of kindness. {25}
I will lend my money to the use of none but indigent men, secured
by such as have ceased to be indigent by the favour of my family or
myself. What makes this the more practicable is, that if they will
do any one good with my money, they are welcome to it upon their
own security: and I make no exception against it, because the {30}
persons who enter into the obligations, do it for their own family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
I have laid out four thousand pounds this way, and it is not to be
imagined what a crowd of people are obliged by it. In cases
where Sir Roger has recommended, I have lent money to put out<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
children, with a clause which makes void the obligation in case the
infant<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> dies before he is out of his apprenticeship; by which means {5}
the kindred and masters are extremely careful of breeding him to
industry, that he may repay it himself by his labour, in three years'
journey-work after his time is out, for the use of his securities.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Opportunities of this kind are all that have occurred since I came
to my estate; but I assure you I will preserve a constant disposition {10}
to catch at all the occasions I can to promote the good and
happiness of my neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"But give me leave to lay before you a little establishment which
has grown out of my past life, that I doubt not will administer
great satisfaction to me in that part of it, whatever that is, which {15}
is to come.</p>

<p>"There is a prejudice in favour of the way of life to which a man
has been educated, which I know not whether it would not be
faulty to overcome. It is like a partiality to the interest of one's
own country before that of any other nation. It is from an habit {20}
of thinking, grown upon me from my youth spent in arms, that I
have ever held gentlemen who have preserved modesty, good-nature,
justice and humanity in a soldier's life, to be the most
valuable and worthy persons of the human race. To pass through
imminent dangers, suffer painful watchings, frightful alarms, and {25}
laborious marches for the greater part of a man's time, and pass
the rest in a sobriety conformable to the rules of the most virtuous
civil life, is a merit too great to deserve the treatment it usually
meets with among the other part of the world. But I assure you,
sir, were there not very many who have this worth, we could never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> {30}
have seen the glorious events which we have in our days. I need
not say more to illustrate the character of a soldier than to tell you he
is the very contrary to him you observe loud, saucy, and overbearing,
in a red coat about town. But I was going to tell you that, in
honour of the profession of arms, I have set apart a certain sum of {<a href="#p216">5</a>}
money for a table for such gentlemen as have served their country
in the army, and will please from time to time to sojourn all or any
part of the year, at Coverley. Such of them as will do me that
honour shall find horses, servants, and all things necessary for their
accommodation and enjoyment of all the conveniences of life in a {10}
pleasant, various<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> country. If Colonel Camperfelt be in town, and
his abilities are not employed another way in the service, there is no
man would be more welcome here. That gentleman's thorough knowledge
in his profession, together with the simplicity of his manners
and goodness of his heart, would induce others like him to honour {15}
my abode; and I should be glad my acquaintance would take themselves
to be invited or not, as their characters have an affinity to his.</p>

<p>"I would have all my friends know that they need not fear
(though I am become a country gentleman) I will trespass against
their temperance and sobriety. No, sir, I shall retain so much of {20}
the good sentiments for the conduct of life which we cultivated in
each other at our club, as to contemn all inordinate pleasures; but
particularly remember, with our beloved Tully,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> that the delight in
food consists in desire, not satiety. They who most passionately
pursue pleasure, seldomest arrive at it. Now I am writing to a {25}
philosopher, I cannot forbear mentioning the satisfaction I took in
the passage I read yesterday in the same Tully. A nobleman of
Athens made a compliment to Plato the morning after he had
supped at his house: 'Your entertainments do not only please
when you give them, but also the day after.' {30}</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES">NOTES</a></h2>

<p>The heavy marginal figures stand for page, and the lighter ones for line</p>


<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Spectator</span></h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="ineg"><b>Motto.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; "He does not lavish at a blaze his fire,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Sudden to glare and in a smoke expire;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">But rises from a cloud of smoke to light,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And pours his specious miracles to sight."</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="i0">&mdash;Horace, <cite>Ars Poetica</cite>, 143. P. Francis's tr.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That is, a well-planned work of art will not begin with a flash and
end in smoke; but, beginning modestly, will grow more lucid and
brilliant as it proceeds. Horace, in the lines immediately preceding
these, quotes in translation the opening words of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> as
an example of a good introduction.</p>

<p>The mottoes of the Spectator papers&mdash;nearly all chosen from the
Latin poets&mdash;are usually, as in this case, very apt. They give a
certain air of dignity and easy scholarship to the treatment of familiar
themes. In a later paper (No. 221, written by Addison) the Spectator
defends himself with charming humour against any charge of
pedantry in the use of them.</p>

<p><b><a id="p45"></a><a href="#Page_45">45</a></b>: 12. <b>My own history.</b> In this paper Addison of course is
not giving us his own history; but he <em>is</em> giving us a truthful picture
of his own temperament. His love of reading and of travel, his
dignified composure, his taciturnity, his habit of quiet observation&mdash;they
are all faithfully set down.</p>

<p><b><a id="p47"></a><a href="#Page_47">47</a></b>: 20. <b>The measure of a pyramid.</b> Addison perhaps had in
mind the works on this subject by John Greaves (1602-1652), a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
mathematician and antiquary; a posthumous pamphlet by him had
recently (1706) been published. Addison's own travels never
extended farther than Italy.</p>

<p><b>47</b>: 28. <b>Place of general resort.</b> The coffee-houses played a
very important part in the London life of Queen Anne's time.
They were frequented by all classes,&mdash;wits and scholars, divines,
politicians, men of business, and men of fashion. Each of the
more famous houses had its own class of patrons, and thus served
as a kind of club. Men frequently had their letters left there&mdash;as
Swift used to do, instead of at his lodgings&mdash;and could count
on meeting congenial acquaintances there at any time. An observant
French traveler, Henri Misson, whose book was translated
in 1719, gives a pleasant glimpse of the coffee-house interior:
"You have all Manner of Newes there: You have a good Fire,
which you may sit by as long as you please; You have a Dish of
Coffee; You meet your Friends for the Transaction of Business;
and all for a Penny, if you don't Care to spend more." In the
better houses, cards or dicing were not allowed, and swearing and
quarrelling were punished by fines.</p>

<p>The coffee-houses mentioned in the text were, in 1710, those
most widely known. Will's, at the corner of Bow and Great Russell
streets, near the Drury Lane Theatre, was the famous house
where, during the last decade of the seventeenth century, the great
Dryden had held his chair as literary dictator, and it was still a favourite
resort both for men of letters and men of affairs; it was from
Will's that Steele dated all those papers in <cite>The Tatler</cite> which were
concerned with poetry. Child's, in St. Paul's church-yard, was frequented
by the clergy and by men of learning; the Grecian, in
Devereaux Court, just off the Strand, was also the resort of scholars
and of barristers from the Temple&mdash;Steele dated from there all
"accounts of learning" in his <cite>Tatler</cite>. The St James, near the
foot of St. James Street, was a thoroughly Whig house, as the Cocoa
Tree on the opposite side of the street was a Tory. Jonathan's, in
Exchange Alley, near the heart of the city, was the headquarters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
stockjobbers. All these were coffee-houses, except the Cocoa Tree,
which called itself a chocolate-house. The chocolate-houses were
few in number, higher in prices, and less popular than the coffee-houses.</p>

<p>Steele gives a pleasant account of coffee-house customs in <cite>Spectator</cite>,
No. 49. See also two papers by Addison on coffee-house
talk, <cite>Spectator</cite>, Nos. 403, 568.</p>

<p>For a fuller account of London Coffee-houses in Addison's time,
see Ashton's <cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, Chap. xviii,
and Besant's <cite>London in the Eighteenth Century</cite>, Chap. xii.</p>

<p><b><a id="p48"></a><a href="#Page_48">48</a></b>: 5. <b>The Postman.</b> One of the little newspapers of the
Queen Anne time, issued thrice a week and edited by a French
Protestant named Fontive.</p>

<p><b>48</b>: 11. <b>Drury Lane and the Haymarket.</b> These two famous
theaters were, in 1710, the only ones open in London.</p>

<p><b>48</b>: 16. <b>Never open my lips but in my own club.</b> "Addison
was perfect good company with intimates; and had something more
charming in his conversation than I ever knew in any other man;
but with any mixture of strangers, and sometimes only with one, he
seemed to preserve his dignity much, with a stiff sort of silence."
Pope, quoted in Spence's <cite>Anecdotes</cite>, p. 38. It will be noticed that
while this taciturnity and reserve were characteristics of Addison,
they were utterly foreign to the disposition of Steele. Steele often
talked too soon and too fast, and he threw himself most heartily
into the game of life.</p>

<p><b>48</b>: 27. <b>Neutrality between the Whigs and Tories.</b> The
Spectator kept this resolve, though the restriction was difficult for
Steele.</p>

<p><b><a id="p50"></a><a href="#Page_50">50</a></b>: 19. <b>Mr. Buckley's in Little Britain.</b> Samuel Buckley was
a printer who, in 1702, had started the first English daily newspaper,
<cite>The Daily Courant</cite>, a little sheet 14 by 8 inches in size. He
undertook to print <cite>The Spectator</cite> for Steele and Addison. Little
Britain is the name of a short street in London, near Smithfield.</p>

<p><b>50</b>: 24. <b>C.</b> All Addison's papers in <cite>The Spectator</cite> are signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
with some one of the four letters forming the word Clio, the name
of the muse of history. Steele's are signed R or T. In <cite>Spectator</cite>,
No. 221, Addison gives a droll comment upon these "Capital
Letters placed at the End of the papers."</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Club</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "But other six and more call out with one voice."&mdash;Juvenal,
<cite>Satires</cite>, vii, 167.</p>

<p><b><a id="p51"></a><a href="#Page_51">51</a></b>: 2. <b>Sir Roger de Coverley.</b> "The still popular dance-tune
from which Addison borrowed the name of Sir Roger de Coverley
in <cite>The Spectator</cite>, is contained in Playford's <cite>Division Violin</cite>, 1685;
in <cite>The Dancing Master</cite> of 1696, and all subsequent editions."&mdash;Chappell,
<cite>Popular Music of the Olden Time</cite>.</p>

<p>Steele says it was Swift who made the happy suggestion of calling
the old knight by the name of the popular dance.</p>

<p><b>51</b>: 4. <b>Country-dance.</b> This seems to be the original form of
which contre-dance and contra-dance are perversions, naturally arising
from the fact that in such dances the men and women stand in
lines facing each other.</p>

<p><b>51</b>: 14. <b>Soho Square.</b> Since the time of Charles II this had
been a fashionable quarter of London, but fell into comparative
disfavour as a place of residence before the close of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>We do not hear again of this town residence of Sir Roger; he
is considered as a country gentleman, who only makes short visits
to London, and then lodges in Norfolk buildings off the Strand.</p>

<p><b><a id="p52"></a><a href="#Page_52">52</a></b>: 1. <b>My Lord Rochester and Sir George Etherege.</b> John
Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647-1680), and Sir George Etherege
(1634-1694) enjoyed some little reputation as poets and more
notoriety as rakes during the reign of Charles II. Etherege had
considerable dramatic ability; but both men covered with a veneer
of fine manners essentially vulgar lives, and both died drunkards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="p53"></a><a href="#Page_53">53</a></b>: 2. <b>Bully Dawson.</b> "A swaggering sharper of Whitefriars."&mdash;Morley.</p>

<p><b>53</b>: 2. <b>Inner Temple.</b> The Inns of Court are legal societies
in London which have the exclusive right of admitting candidates
to the bar, and provide instruction and examinations for that purpose.
There are four of these Inns of Court,&mdash;Lincoln's Inn, Gray's
Inn, the Middle Temple, and the Inner Temple. The last two
derive their names from the fact that they occupy buildings and
gardens on the site formerly belonging to the military order of
Knights Templar, which was dissolved in the fourteenth century.
The famous Temple Church is the only one of the buildings of the
great Knights Templar establishment that now remains. We hear
but little of the Templar in the following papers; Steele did not
find the character as interesting as it might have been expected he
would.</p>

<p><b>53</b>: 8. <b>Aristotle</b> (384-322 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), the greatest of Greek philosophers
in his influence upon later thought, was also perhaps the
greatest, as he was the first, of literary critics. The Templar
probably cared quite as much for Aristotle's <cite>Rhetoric</cite> and <cite>Poetics</cite>
as for his philosophical works.</p>

<p><b>53</b>: 9. <b>Longinus</b> (210-273) was the author of a treatise <cite>On the
Sublime</cite>, more admired two centuries ago than it is to-day.</p>

<p><b>53</b>: 9. <b>Littleton.</b> Sir Thomas Littleton (1402-1481), a noted
English jurist, author of a famous work in French on <cite>Tenures</cite>.</p>

<p><b>53</b>: 10. <b>Coke.</b> <cite>The Institutes of Sir Edward Coke</cite> (1552-1634),
a reprint and translation of Littleton's book, with copious
comment,&mdash;hence popularly known as <cite>Coke on Littleton</cite>,&mdash;are
a great authority upon the law of real property.</p>

<p><b>53</b>: 17. <b>Tully.</b> Marcus Tullius Cicero.</p>

<p><b>53</b>: 29. <b>Exactly at five.</b> In the Queen Anne days the play
began at six, or often as early as five. The Templar is going to
the Drury Lane Theatre. He passes New Inn, which was one of
the buildings of the Middle Temple, crosses the Strand, and through
Russell Court reaches Will's Coffee-house, where he looks in for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
coffee and the news, and he has his shoes rubbed and his wig
powdered at the barber's by the Rose Tavern, which stood just
beside the theatre.</p>

<p><b><a id="p54"></a><a href="#Page_54">54</a></b>: 6. <b>Sir Andrew Freeport.</b> Steele's Whig sympathies may
be seen in this picture of the intelligent and enterprising merchant.
The trading classes of England belonged then almost entirely to
the Whig party; the landed aristocracy, on the other hand, country
squire and country parson, were almost always Tories. See note
on p. 242.</p>

<p><b>54</b>: 22. <b>A penny got.</b> This would seem to be the source of
Franklin's Poor Richard's maxim, "A penny saved is a penny
earned."</p>

<p><b><a id="p57"></a><a href="#Page_57">57</a></b>: 6. <b>Hoods.</b> The hood was an important article of woman's
attire at this time. See Addison's delightful paper, <cite>Spectator</cite>,
No. 265.</p>

<p><b>57</b>: 12. <b>The Duke of Monmouth.</b> The natural son of Charles
II, who, during the reign of James II, in 1685, invaded England
and attempted to seize the crown; but was defeated in the battle of
Sedgemoor,&mdash;the last battle fought on English soil,&mdash;taken prisoner,
and executed on Tower Hill. He was a young man of little ability;
but his personal beauty and engaging manners won him many
friends. See the portrait of him as Absalom in Dryden's <cite>Absalom
and Achitophel</cite>, 29, 30:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"His motions all accompanied with grace,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And Paradise was opened in his face."</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b><a id="p58"></a><a href="#Page_58">58</a></b>: 23. <b>R.</b> One of Steele's signatures. See note, p. 219.</p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Sir Roger's Criticisms on Polite Society</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "They used to think it a great crime, even deserving of
death, if a young man did not rise up in the presence of an elder."&mdash;Juvenal,
<cite>Satires</cite>, xiii. 54.</p>

<p><b><a id="p59"></a><a href="#Page_59">59</a></b>: 6. <b>Wit and sense.</b> These were reckoned in the Queen
Anne time the cardinal virtues not only of literature, but of society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Keenness and quickness of intellect, grace of form in letters,
urbanity and good breeding, brilliancy of converse in society&mdash;these
were the qualities the age most admired. This paper is one
of many written by Steele to protest against the divorce of these
qualities from morality and religion.</p>

<p><b>59</b>: 9. <b>Abandoned writings of men of wit.</b> Steele probably
has especially in mind the drama of his time. English comedy
was never so witty and never so abandoned as in the fifty years
following the Restoration.</p>

<p><b><a id="p60"></a><a href="#Page_60">60</a></b>: 8. <b>Lincoln's Inn Fields.</b> A large square just west of
Lincoln's Inn, at this time much frequented by beggars and
sharpers.</p>

<p><b><a id="p61"></a><a href="#Page_61">61</a></b>: 24. <b>Sir Richard Blackmore</b> (1650-1729), a dull, long-winded
poet of the time, whose verse has little beside its virtue to
recommend it. In the Preface to his long philosophical poem,
<cite>The Creation</cite>, published a few months after this paper was written,
he inveighs at great length against the licentiousness and atheism
of men of wit and letters; but the sentences in the text seem to
be quoted, though inaccurately, from the Preface to his earlier epic,
<cite>Prince Arthur</cite> (1695).</p>


<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Club and the Spectator</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "A wild beast spares his own kind."&mdash;Juvenal, <cite>Satires</cite>,
xv. 159.</p>

<p><b><a id="p65"></a><a href="#Page_65">65</a></b>: 13. <b>The opera and the puppet-show.</b> The absurd unrealities
of the Italian opera, then recently introduced into England,
were a subject of frequent sarcastic comment in <cite>The Spectator</cite>.
"Audiences," says Addison, "have often been reproached by writers
for the coarseness of their taste; but our present grievance
does not seem to be the want of a good taste, but of common
sense." For strictures on the opera, see Nos. 1, 13, 18, 22, 29, 31.</p>

<p><b>65</b>: 15. <b>Dress and equipage of persons of quality.</b> Perhaps
he refers to No. 16, in which the Spectator had ventured some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
criticism upon muffs and garters and fringed gloves and other
"foppish ornaments."</p>

<p><b>65</b>: 19. <b>The city.</b> Technically "the city" is that part of
London north of the Thames from Temple Bar on the west to the
Tower on the east, and extending as far as Finsbury on the north,
which constituted the original walled city of London. It is the
part of London under the immediate control of the lord mayor
and aldermen, and its residents are "citizens." The trade and
business of London was in Addison's time almost entirely&mdash;and
still is very largely&mdash;included in this area.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Freeport, as a merchant, of course stands up for the
city.</p>

<p><b><a id="p66"></a><a href="#Page_66">66</a></b>: 4. <b>The wits of King Charles's time.</b> The comedies of
the writers of the time of Charles II&mdash;Farquhar, Wycherley, Congreve,
Vanbrugh&mdash;usually turn upon intrigue of which the wives
and daughters of citizens are the victims.</p>

<p><b>66</b>: 6. <b>Horace</b> (65-8 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) and <b>Juvenal</b> (<i>circa</i> 60-140 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>),
the masters of Latin satire; <b>Boileau</b> (1636-1711), a French satirist
and critic.</p>

<p><b>66</b>: 12. <b>Persons of the Inns of Court.</b> See <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 21.</p>

<p><b>66</b>: 25. <b>Fox hunters.</b> Whatever Mr. Spectator may have said
in private, it does not seem that he had thus far written any paper
disparaging fox hunters. A later essay, No. 474,&mdash;not written by
Addison,&mdash;is rather severe upon them. Addison's famous picture
of the Tory fox hunter is found in <cite>The Freeholder</cite>, No. 22.</p>

<p><b><a id="p67"></a><a href="#Page_67">67</a></b>: 23. <b>Vices ... too trivial for the chastisement of the
law, and too fantastical for the cognizance of the pulpit.</b> This
is an admirable indication of the range and purpose of the Spectator's
satire.</p>

<p><b><a id="p68"></a><a href="#Page_68">68</a></b>: 16. <b>The Roman triumvirate.</b> Octavius, Antony, Lepidus.
For the account of their "debate," see Plutarch's <cite>Life of
Mark Antony</cite> or Shakespeare's version of it in <cite>Julius CÃ¦sar</cite>, iv. 1.</p>

<p><b>68</b>: 27. <b>Punch.</b> One Robert Powell, a hunchbacked dwarf,
kept a puppet show, or "Punch's theatre," in Covent Garden. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
speech of Punch was often very broad. See Ashton's <cite>Social Life
in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, p. 215.</p>


<h3>V. <span class="smcap">A Lady's Library</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "She had not accustomed her woman's hands to the distaff
or the skeins of Minerva."&mdash;Virgil, <cite>Ãneid</cite>, vii. 305.</p>

<p><b><a id="p69"></a><a href="#Page_69">69</a></b>: 13. <b>Leonora.</b> A letter from a Leonora, perhaps the lady
of this paper, is to be found in <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 91.</p>

<p><b><a id="p70"></a><a href="#Page_70">70</a></b>: 4. <b>Great jars of china.</b> The craze for collecting china
was then at its height. It is satirized by Steele in <cite>Tatler</cite>, No. 23,
and by Addison in No. 10 of <cite>The Lover</cite>.</p>

<p><b>70</b>: 17. <b>Scaramouches.</b> The Scaramouch is a typical buffoon
in Italian farces; the name is derived from Scaramuccia, a famous
Italian clown of the last half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><b>70</b>: 20. <b>Snuff box.</b> This indicates that the habit of snuff
taking had been adopted by fine ladies. It would seem, however,
to have been a new fashion, at all events with ladies. See Steele's
criticism upon the habit in <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 344. For curious facts
with reference to the use of tobacco in the Queen Anne time, see
Ashton, <cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, Chap. xvii.</p>

<p><b><a id="p71"></a><a href="#Page_71">71</a></b>: 3. <b>Looking into the books</b>, etc. The humour consists
largely, of course, in the odd miscellany of books suited "to the
lady and the scholar."</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 9. <b>Ogilby's Virgil</b>, the first complete translation of Virgil,
1649.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 10. <b>Dryden's Juvenal</b>, 1693.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 11, 12, 13. <b>Cassandra</b>, <b>Cleopatra</b>, and <b>Astraea</b> were translations
of long-winded, sentimental French romances, the first two
by La CalprenÃ¨de, the third by HonorÃ© D'UrfÃ©.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 15. <b>The Grand Cyrus</b> and <b>Clelia</b> were even more famous
romances, by Mademoiselle de ScudÃ©ry, each in ten volumes. For
delightful satire upon the taste for this sort of reading, see Steele's
comedy, <cite>The Tender Husband</cite>; the heroine, Miss Biddy Tipkin,
has been nourished upon this delicate literature.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 17. <b>Pembroke's Arcadia.</b> Written in 1580-1581, by Sir
Philip Sidney, but published, after his death, by his sister, the
Countess of Pembroke. It is the best of the Elizabethan prose
romances.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 18. <b>Locke.</b> John Locke's <cite>Essay on the Human Understanding</cite>,
an epoch-making work in philosophy, published in 1690.
Locke was one of the authors Leonora had "heard praised," and
may have "seen"; but she evidently found better use for his book
than to read it. The "patches" were bits of black silk or paper,
cut in a variety of forms, which ladies stuck upon their faces, presumably
to set off their complexions. See <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 81.
Notice the pun in this use of Locke.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 22. <b>Sherlock.</b> William Sherlock (1641-1707), dean of St.
Paul's.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 23. <b>The Fifteen Comforts of Matrimony</b>, a translation
of a French book of the fifteenth century, <cite>Quinze Joies de Mariage</cite>.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 24. <b>Sir William Temple's Essays</b>, published 1692.</p>

<p><b>71</b>: 25. <b>Malebranche's Search after Truth</b> had been translated
from the French not long before.</p>

<p><b><a id="p72"></a><a href="#Page_72">72</a></b>: 1. <b>The Ladies' Calling</b>, a popular religious book,
anonymous, but ascribed to the unknown author of the most
widely circulated religious book of the seventeenth century, <cite>The
Whole Duty of Man</cite>.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 2. <b>Mr. D'Urfey.</b> Thomas D'Urfey (1650-1720), a playwright
and humorous verse writer. His poetical writings were collected,
1720, under the title, <cite>Pills to purge Melancholy</cite>. In 1704 he
published <cite>Tales, Tragical and Comical</cite>, which is probably the book
here referred to.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 6. <b>Clelia.</b> See note on 71: 15.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 8. <b>Baker's Chronicle.</b> <cite>Sir Richard Baker's Chronicle</cite>

this dull book. See <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 329, XXVIII of this volume.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 9. <b>Advice to a Daughter.</b> By George Saville, Marquis
of Halifax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p><b>72</b>: 10. <b>The New Atalantis.</b> By Mrs. Manley, who had an
unsavoury reputation in London journalism during the reign of
Anne. This was a scandalous romance, attacking prominent persons,
especially of the Whig party, under feigned names.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 11. <b>Mr. Steele's Christian Hero.</b> See Introduction.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 14. <b>Dr. Sacheverell's Speech.</b> A Tory high-church
preacher who was impeached before the House of Lords for two
violent sermons assailing the Whig party. His trial caused great
excitement, and was one of the events immediately preceding the
downfall of the Whigs in 1710. The "speech" here mentioned is
that delivered in his own defence. It is said to have been written
for him by Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 15. <b>Fielding's Trial.</b> One Robert Fielding, tried for
bigamy early in the century.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 16. <b>Seneca's Morals.</b> <cite>The Moral Essays of Seneca</cite> (4
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>-65 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>). The translation of Roger L'Estrange was popular
at this time.</p>

<p><b>72</b>: 17. <b>Taylor's Holy Living and Dying.</b> Jeremy Taylor
(1613-1667), the most eloquent of English divines.</p>

<p><b><a id="p74"></a><a href="#Page_74">74</a></b>: 22. <b>To give me their thoughts upon it.</b> Some of "their
thoughts" may be found in Nos. 92 and 340.</p>


<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">Coverley Hall</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "Hence shall flow to the full for thee, from kindly horn, a
wealth of rural honours."&mdash;Horace, <cite>Odes</cite>, I. xvii. 14-17.</p>

<p><b><a id="p77"></a><a href="#Page_77">77</a></b>: 7. <b>The nature of a chaplain.</b> The religious influence
of the clergy, especially of the country clergy, was doubtless very
small in the Queen Anne time. For their condition and work, see
Macaulay's famous Chapter iii. in his <cite>History of England</cite>; Lecky's
<cite>History of England in the Eighteenth Century</cite>, Chap. ii; Ashton's
<cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, Chap. xxxii; Besant's
<cite>London in the Eighteenth Century</cite>, chapter on Church and Chapel.
Abundant confirmation of this low estimate of the character and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>fluence
of the clergy may be found in contemporary literature. For
example, see Swift's <cite>Project for the Advancement of Religion</cite>, his
satirical <cite>Argument against the Abolishing of Christianity</cite>, and
<cite>Letter to a Young Clergyman</cite>.</p>

<p>Yet it must be remembered that the Whig prejudices of Addison
inclined him, in his kindly satire, to belittle the attainments and
the influence of the country clergy, who were, almost to a man,
Tories.</p>

<p><b><a id="p79"></a><a href="#Page_79">79</a></b>: 3. <b>Bishop of St. Asaph</b> may have been either William
Beveridge (1637-1708) or his successor, William Fleetwood (1656-1723);
both had, before this time, published volumes of sermons.</p>

<p><b>79</b>: 4. <b>Dr. South.</b> Robert South (1633-1716), a very high
churchman and a very eloquent preacher.</p>

<p><b>79</b>: 6. <b>Tillotson.</b> John Tillotson (1630-1694), made Archbishop
of Canterbury three years before his death.</p>

<p><b>79</b>: 7. <b>Saunderson.</b> Robert Saunderson (1587-1663), Bishop
of Lincoln.</p>

<p><b>79</b>: 7. <b>Barrow.</b> Isaac Barrow (1630-1677) was eminent both
as a theologian and a mathematician.</p>

<p><b>79</b>: 7. <b>Calamy.</b> Edmund Calamy (1600-1666) is the only one
in the chaplain's list of preachers who was not a Churchman;
Calamy was a Presbyterian, though a liberal one, who served a
little time as chaplain of Charles II.</p>


<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">The Coverley Household</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "The Athenians raised a colossal statue to Ãsop, though
a slave, and placed it on a lasting foundation, to show that the path of
Honor is open to all."&mdash;Phaedrus, <cite>Epilogue</cite>, 2.</p>

<p><b><a id="p80"></a><a href="#Page_80">80</a></b>: 4. <b>Corruption of manners in servants.</b> For interesting
details, see Ashton's <cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>,
Chap. vi, Servants. Steele had already written a paper on the
subject, <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 88.</p>

<p><b><a id="p83"></a><a href="#Page_83">83</a></b>: 4. <b>Put his servants into independent livelihoods.</b> Note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the inconsistency of the statement with those of the previous paper.
The two papers were written at the same time,&mdash;they were printed
on two consecutive days,&mdash;and Steele and Addison, it is evident,
did not very carefully avoid slight inconsistencies.</p>


<h3>VIII. <span class="smcap">Will Wimble</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "Out of breath for naught; doing many things, yet accomplishing
nothing."&mdash;Phaedrus, <cite>Fables</cite>, II. v. 3.</p>

<p><b><a id="p85"></a><a href="#Page_85">85</a></b>: 6. <b>Wimble.</b> A wimble is a gimlet&mdash;the two words are
probably from the same root. Possibly, as some of his editors have
suggested, Addison meant to indicate that Will Wimble was a small
bore. Quite as possibly he meant that the fellow was always turning
about, yet making a very small hole.</p>

<p><b><a id="p86"></a><a href="#Page_86">86</a></b>: 1. <b>Eton.</b> The most famous of English schools; in sight
of Windsor Castle.</p>

<p><b>86</b>: 8. <b>Younger brother.</b> By English law the eldest son succeeds
to the family estate and titles.</p>

<p><b>86</b>: 21. <b>A tulip-root.</b> About the middle of the seventeenth century
there was a craze for tulips in England. The bulbs were grown
in Holland, and were sold for fabulous prices. Dealing in them
became a kind of speculation, and tulip bulbs were bought and
sold on the exchange, as stocks are now, without changing hands
at all. As much as a thousand pounds has been paid, it is said,
for a single bulb. The Dutch government finally passed a law that
no more than two hundred francs should be charged for one bulb.
By the time this paper was written the mania had mostly passed,
yet tulips were still highly prized. In <cite>The Tatler</cite>, Addison has a
pleasant paper (No. 218) telling of a cook maid who mistook a
"handful of tulip-roots for a heap of onions and by that means
made a dish of pottage that cost above a thousand pounds sterling."
Forty years later, young Oliver Goldsmith, when a medical student
in Leyden, almost beggared himself by the purchase of a parcel of
tulip-roots to send to his good uncle Contarine in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="p89"></a><a href="#Page_89">89</a></b>: 1. <b>Trading nation, like ours.</b> In such passages as this
Addison betrays his Whig sympathies. The trading and moneyed
classes, it will be remembered, were all in the Whig party; the
landed aristocracy, in the Tory party. In <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 21,&mdash;referred
to in the closing lines of this paper,&mdash;he dwells at length
on the opportunities and advantages of the business life as compared
with the overcrowded professions.</p>


<h3>IX. <span class="smcap">The Coverley Ancestry</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "Wise, but not by rule."&mdash;Horace. <cite>Satires</cite>, II. ii. 3.</p>

<p><b><a id="p90"></a><a href="#Page_90">90</a></b>: 19. <b>Harry the Seventh.</b> Henry VII, king of England,
1485-1509.</p>

<p><b>90</b>: 19. <b>Yeomen of the guard.</b> The bodyguard of the sovereign,
numbering one hundred, who attend him at banquets and
other state occasions. They are popularly called "beefeaters," and
still wear the uniform here described. The wardens of the Tower
of London wear a uniform differing but slightly from that of the
yeomen of the guard.</p>

<p><b>90</b>: 28. <b>The Tilt-yard</b> occupied not only a part of the "common
street," now called Whitehall, but the greater part of the
"parade ground" in St. James's Park, just behind the Horse
Guards building.</p>

<p><b><a id="p91"></a><a href="#Page_91">91</a></b>: 14. <b>The coffee-house.</b> Jenny Man's coffee-house, one of
the best known in London, stood on the spot now occupied by the
paymaster general's office.</p>

<p><b>91</b>: 24. <b>New-fashioned petticoat.</b> The hooped petticoat has
made its appearance, in various forms, at various times, throughout
the history of British female attire. Sir Roger's grandmother
apparently wore what was called the "wheel farthingale," a drum-shaped
petticoat worn in the late sixteenth century. The form in
vogue in Addison's time&mdash;it came in about 1707&mdash;was bell
shaped, and of most liberal dimensions. For some admirable fool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>ing
upon it, see <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 127, and <cite>Tatler</cite>, No. 116, both by
Addison.</p>

<p><b><a id="p92"></a><a href="#Page_92">92</a></b>: 4. <b>White-pot.</b> Made of cream, rice, sugar, and cinnamon,
etc. It was a favourite Devonshire dish, as the famous "clotted
cream" of Devon is now.</p>

<p><b><a id="p93"></a><a href="#Page_93">93</a></b>: 9. <b>Sir Andrew Freeport has said.</b> Sir Andrew characteristically
stands up for the citizens and the moneyed interest. Later
on he reminds Sir Roger of the obligation of his family to trade.
See <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 174, XXVII of this volume.</p>

<p><b>93</b>: 15. <b>Turned my face.</b> Note the delicate courtesy of the
Spectator.</p>

<p><b><a id="p94"></a><a href="#Page_94">94</a></b>: 20. <b>The battle of Worcester</b>, September 3, 1651, in
which Cromwell defeated the Scots, supporters of Charles II.</p>

<p><b><a id="p98"></a><a href="#Page_98">98</a></b>: 12. <b>The relations of particular persons who are now
living.</b> Addison's opinion as to the reality of ghosts and apparitions
was shared by most people of his time, the thoughtful and
educated as well as the ignorant.</p>

<p><b>98</b>: 17. <b>Lucretius.</b> A Roman poet of the century before Christ,
whose one work, <cite>De Rerum Natura</cite>, is a philosophic poem, showing
much subtlety of thought. The "notion" referred to in the
text is found in the early part of the Fourth Book of the <cite>De Rerum
Natura</cite>.</p>

<p><b><a id="p99"></a><a href="#Page_99">99</a></b>: 4. <b>Josephus</b> (37-95 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>). The Jewish historian. The passage

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI. <span class="smcap">Sunday with Sir Roger</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "First honour the immortal gods, as it is commanded by
law."&mdash;Pythagoras, <cite>Fragments</cite>.</p>

<p><b><a id="p101"></a><a href="#Page_101">101</a></b>: 20. <b>Instruct them rightly in the tunes of the Psalms.</b>
The service in the parish churches throughout England at this
time was slovenly and spiritless. Samuel Wesley, father of John,
who was then rector of the parish of Epworth, complains that his
people prefer the "sorry Sternhold Psalms," have "a strange genius
at understanding nonsense," and sing decently only "after it has
cost a pretty deal to teach them."</p>

<p><b><a id="p103"></a><a href="#Page_103">103</a></b>: 10. <b>The clerk's place.</b> In the English parishes the clerk
is the layman who leads in reading the responses of the church
service.</p>

<p><b>103</b>: 23. <b>Tithe stealers.</b> Tithes are a tax, estimated as a tenth
(tithe) of the annual profits from land and stock, appropriated for
the support of the clergy. The tithes in England are now commuted
to rent charges.</p>


<h3>XII. <span class="smcap">Sir Roger in Love</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "(Her) features remain imprinted on (his) heart."&mdash;Virgil,
<cite>Ãneid</cite>, iv. 4.</p>

<p><b><a id="p105"></a><a href="#Page_105">105</a></b>: 1. <b>The perverse widow.</b> Ingenious commentators have
thought to identify the lady with a certain Mrs. Catherine Bovey,
to whom Steele dedicated the second volume of his <cite>Ladies Library</cite>;
but it seems altogether improbable that Steele and Addison would
intend any of their characters as actual portraits.</p>

<p><b><a id="p108"></a><a href="#Page_108">108</a></b>: 20. <b>Such a desperate scholar that no country gentleman
can approach her.</b> It is probable that Sir Roger's estimate
of the scholarship of country gentlemen in his time does them no
great injustice. Macaulay says of the country squire at the end of
the seventeenth century: "If he went to school and to college,
he generally returned before he was twenty to the seclusion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
old hall, and then, unless his mind was very happily constituted by
nature, soon forgot his academical pursuits in rural business and
pleasures. His chief serious employment was the care of his property....
His chief pleasures were commonly derived from field
sports and from unrefined sensuality. His language and pronunciation
were such as we should now expect to hear only from the
most ignorant clowns."&mdash;<cite>History of England</cite>, Chap. iii.</p>

<p><b><a id="p109"></a><a href="#Page_109">109</a></b>: 20. <b>Sphinx.</b> The sphinx was sent by Juno to devastate
the country of the Thebans, until some one could answer her riddle,
"What animal goes on four feet in the morning, two at noon, and
three at night?" [OE]dipus gave the right answer, "Man," and so
saved his countrymen.</p>

<p><b><a id="p110"></a><a href="#Page_110">110</a></b>: 3. <b>Her tucker.</b> The tucker was an edging of muslin or
lace at the top of the dress, covering the neck and bosom.</p>

<p><b>110</b>: 8. <b>Some tansy.</b> A kind of pudding flavored with tansy.</p>

<p><b>110</b>: 24. <b>Dum tacet hanc loquitur.</b> Even when silent he is
speaking of her.</p>

<p><b>110</b>: 25. <b>Epigram.</b> Martial, <cite>Epigram</cite>, I. lxviii. The last two
lines of the epigram are not quoted.</p>


<h3>XIII. <span class="smcap">How to bear Poverty</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "The shame of poverty and the fear of it."&mdash;Horace,
<cite>Epistles</cite>, I. xviii. 24.</p>

<p><b><a id="p111"></a><a href="#Page_111">111</a></b>: 16. <b>The glass was taken ... pretty plentifully.</b> The
Queen Anne men were not very temperate. Says Mr. Lecky: "The
amount of hard drinking among the upper classes was still very
great, and it is remarkable how many of the most conspicuous characters
were addicted to it. Addison, the foremost moralist of his
time, was not free from it. Oxford, whose private character was in
most respects singularly high, is said to have come, not infrequently,
drunk into the very presence of the Queen."&mdash;<cite>England in the
Eighteenth Century</cite>, Chap. iii.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Swift writes in his <cite>Journal to Stella</cite>, October 31, 1710: "I dined
with Mr. Addison and Dick Stuart. They were both half fuddled;
but not I."</p>

<p><b><a id="p113"></a><a href="#Page_113">113</a></b>: 13, 19. <b>Laertes ... Irus.</b> Classical names were frequently
taken for imaginary personages by the writers of this time. Laertes,
in Homer's <cite>Odyssey</cite>, is the father of Ulysses, and Irus is a beggar.</p>

<p><b>113</b>: 16. <b>Four shillings in the pound.</b> Laertes evidently has
to pay three hundred pounds a year interest on his mortgage of six
thousand pounds, which is one fifth of his whole income, or "four
shillings in the pound."</p>

<p><b>113</b>: 18. <b>Easier in his own fortune.</b> Because, of course, he
has to pay taxes on his whole estate.</p>

<p><b><a id="p114"></a><a href="#Page_114">114</a></b>: 25. <b>Mr. Cowley.</b> Abraham Cowley (1618-1667), one
of the most popular poets of the second third of the seventeenth
century. The vogue of his poetry, however, rapidly declined; but
his prose essays are still very pleasant reading. The essay which
Steele seems to refer to in the latter part of this paragraph is that
on <cite>Greatness</cite>, which closes with a translation of Horace's Ode,
<cite>Odi profanum</cite>, Bk. iii. 1.</p>

<p><b>114</b>: 28. <b>The elegant author who published his works.</b>
Thomas Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, who issued a complete edition
of Cowley's Poetical Works, prefaced with a Life, in 1680. Sprat's
<cite>Life of Cowley</cite> is one of the most interesting pieces of biography
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><b><a id="p115"></a><a href="#Page_115">115</a></b>: 5. <b>Great vulgar.</b> The phrase is from the second line of
Cowley's translation of the <cite>Odi profanum</cite> of Horace, above mentioned:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"Hence, ye profane! I hate ye all,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">Both the great vulgar and the small."</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But Steele's sentence is certainly obscure.</p>

<p><b><a id="p116"></a><a href="#Page_116">116</a></b>: 11. <b>If e'er ambition did my fancy cheat</b>, etc. These
lines are Cowley's own, and are inserted in the essay on <cite>Greatness</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIV. <span class="smcap">Labour and Exercise</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "That there may be a sound mind in a sound body."&mdash;Juvenal,
<cite>Satires</cite>, x. 356.</p>

<p><b><a id="p117"></a><a href="#Page_117">117</a></b>: 21. <b>Ferments the humours.</b> It was an old medical notion
that in the body there are four <em>humours</em> or fluids,&mdash;blood, phlegm,
choler, and bile,&mdash;and that health depended upon the due proportion
and mixture of these humours. This conception influenced
popular language, after it was in great part discarded by more accurate
medical knowledge. It will be noticed throughout this paper
that Addison's hygiene is better than his physiology.</p>

<p><b>117</b>: 28. <b>Refining those spirits.</b> The name animal spirits was
given to a subtle fluid which, according to ancient medical notions,
permeated the body and served in some way as the medium of sensation
and volition. In its looser and more recent use the phrase
means little more than nervous energy or sometimes physical
vivacity.</p>

<p><b><a id="p118"></a><a href="#Page_118">118</a></b>: 3. <b>The spleen</b> was supposed to be the seat of melancholy
or fretfulness, hence was often used for the melancholy
itself.</p>

<p><b>118</b>: 5. <b>Vapours.</b> The blues, especially used of women.</p>

<p><b><a id="p120"></a><a href="#Page_120">120</a></b>: 8. <b>Dr. Sydenham.</b> Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689), the
most noted physician of his time, surnamed "the English Hippocrates."</p>

<p><b>120</b>: 12. <b>Medicina Gymnastica</b>, <cite>or a Treatise concerning the
Power of Exercise</cite>, by Francis Fuller, published in 1704.</p>

<p><b>120</b>: 14. <b>Exercise myself an hour every morning.</b> It may
be doubted whether Mr. Addison kept up this healthful practice.
At all events, like most of the fat club goers of the age, he gave evidence
in his later years of the need of more vigorous physical exercise,
and he died at the early age of forty-seven.</p>

<p><b>120</b>: 23. <b>A Latin treatise of exercises.</b> <cite>Artis Gymnasticae

<h3>XV. <span class="smcap">Sir Roger goes A-Hunting</span></h3>

<p>This paper and XXX of the present collection were written by
Eustace Budgell. This sanguine, brilliant, but ill-starred young
man was a cousin of Addison's, an Oxford graduate, and a writer of
considerable promise. He was introduced to public life by Addison,
whom he accompanied as clerk when Addison went to Ireland as
secretary. For a time Budgell was a member of the Irish Parliament,
and seemed to have a successful career in prospect both in politics
and in letters; but he became involved in unfortunate financial
speculations, especially in the notorious South Sea Bubble, was
guilty of forgery in his efforts to extricate himself, and finally, in
despair, drowned himself in the Thames.</p>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "Cithaeron calls aloud and the dogs on Mount Taygetus."&mdash;Virgil,
<cite>Georgics</cite>, iii. 43.</p>

<p>Cithaeron and Taygetus were mountains, the one in Boeotia and the
other in Laconia.</p>

<p><b><a id="p121"></a><a href="#Page_121">121</a></b>: 18. <b>The Bastile</b> (modern spelling, Bastille). The famous
prison, for prisoners of state, in Paris; destroyed at the beginning
of the French Revolution, July 14, 1789. The 14th of July is still
a national holiday in France.</p>

<p><b><a id="p123"></a><a href="#Page_123">123</a></b>: 19. <b>Midsummer Night's Dream</b>, iv. 1. 124.</p>

<p><b><a id="p126"></a><a href="#Page_126">126</a></b>: 20. <b>Threw down his pole.</b> Such of the hunters as followed
the chase on foot usually carried long vaulting poles, by the
aid of which they could leap hedges, ditches, or miry places, and
thus, by going cross country, often keep as close to the dogs as the

<p><b><a id="p127"></a><a href="#Page_127">127</a></b>: 7. <b>Pascal.</b> Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), French geometrician
and philosopher, and one of the most acute thinkers of his
century. His later years were passed in the celebrated community
of Port Royal, where his metaphysical and religious works were
written. After his death, a number of fragmentary papers intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
for a work in defence of Christianity, which he did not live to finish,
were collected and published under the title <cite>PensÃ©es de M. Pascal
sur la Religion</cite> (Thoughts of Pascal upon Religion). It is from
the seventh section (<cite>MisÃ¨re de l'homme</cite>) of this work that the
quotation in the text is taken.</p>

<p><b>127</b>: 27. <b>Too great an application to his studies in his youth.</b>
Pascal wrote a famous Latin treatise on Conic Sections at the age
of sixteen, invented a calculating machine at the age of nineteen,
and before he was twenty-one was accounted one of the first
mathematicians of the world. But he says that from the age of
eighteen he never passed a day without pain.</p>

the representative English poet of the last half of the seventeenth
century. The lines quoted are from his Epistle XV, to his cousin
of the same name as himself, John Dryden of Chesterton, a robust,
fox-hunting bachelor. The epistle is a good example of Dryden's
masculine common-sense.</p>


<h3>XVI. <span class="smcap">The Coverley Witch</span></h3>

<p><b>Motto.</b> "They make their own visions."&mdash;Virgil, <cite>Eclogues</cite>, viii. 108.</p>

<p><b><a id="p129"></a><a href="#Page_129">129</a></b>: 9. <b>The subject of witchcraft.</b> The Spectator was less credulous,
on this matter of witchcraft, than most of his contemporaries.
The witchcraft craze in Salem, Massachusetts, occurred in 1692;
only a few years before this paper was written, two women had
been hanged in Northampton, England, for witchcraft; and as late
as 1716 a certain Mrs. Hicks and her daughter were executed in
Huntingdon for selling their souls to the devil, etc. The statute of
James I, 1603, punishing witchcraft by death, was not repealed until
1736; and the belief in witchcraft continued to be common long
after that, not only among the ignorant, but among the educated.
John Wesley, on most matters a man of very sound practical judgement,
writes in his <cite>Journal</cite> as late as 1770: "I cannot give up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
all the Deists in Great Britain the existence of witchcraft till I give
up the credit of all history, sacred and profane. And at the present
time I have not only as strong but stronger proofs of this from
eye and ear witnesses than I have of murder; so that I cannot
rationally doubt of one any more than the other." And Samuel
Johnson, when questioned by Boswell on the matter, while he
would "not affirm anything positively upon the subject," reminded
Mr. Boswell that in support of witchcraft "You have not only the
general report and belief, but many solemn, voluntary confessions."
(Boswell's <cite>Life of Samuel Johnson</cite>, April 9, 1772.)</p>

<p>For an account of the kind of evidence used against alleged
witches, see a case cited in Ashton's <cite>Social Life in the Reign of
Queen Anne</cite>, Chap. x.</p>

<p><b><a id="p130"></a><a href="#Page_130">130</a></b>: 19. <b>Otway.</b> Thomas Otway (1651-1685), the best tragic

tragedy, <cite>The Orphan</cite>, ii. 1.</p>

<p><b><a id="p131"></a><a href="#Page_131">131</a></b>: 8. <b>Carried her several hundreds of miles.</b> In accordance
with the superstition that a witch rode through the air at
night on a broomstick. Other superstitions are referred to in the
following lines.</p>

<p><b>131</b>: 15. <b>Take a pin of her.</b> Because bewitched people were
frequently said to be tormented with pins, or to be made to vomit
pins. The pins that figured so conspicuously in the Salem witchcraft
trials may still be seen in the Museum there.</p>

<p><b><a id="p132"></a><a href="#Page_132">132</a></b>: 5. <b>A tabby cat.</b> A black cat was traditionally supposed
to be a favourite form in which Satan embodied himself, and hence
a constant figure in all witchcraft stories.</p>

<p><b>132</b>: 15. <b>Advising her, as a justice of peace.</b> This sentence
admirably indicates Sir Roger's half belief in the preternatural
powers of the old woman, and his anxiety to avoid any trouble
that would oblige him to come to a conclusion in the matter.</p>

<p><b>132</b>: 24. <b>Trying experiments with her.</b> Because, if she
floated, she was accounted a witch; if she sank, she was probably
innocent, and they might pull her out.</p>

<p><b><a id="p140"></a><a href="#Page_140">140</a></b>: 11. <b>The fashionable world is grown free and easy.</b>
This tendency in manners began to be more marked after the Restoration,
1660. Some reaction toward a more formal and elaborate
courtesy in the world of fashion could be seen about the middle
of the eighteenth century, under the influence of such men as Lord
Chesterfield.</p>

<p><b><a id="p143"></a><a href="#Page_143">143</a></b>: 2. <b>Red coats and laced hats</b> were fashionable twenty
years before Addison was writing. In 1711 the coat was likely to
be of some more quiet color, though in great variety of shades.
At just this time the skirts were "wired" to make them stand
out&mdash;as may be seen by a reference in <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 145. The
laced hat had been replaced by a low-crowned, black felt hat,
with very wide brim, which was looped up or "cocked." For the
variety of shapes into which the dandy would cock his hat, and
other information on the hat, see <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 319.</p>

<p><b>143</b>: 4. <b>The height of their head-dresses.</b> The head-dress
had evidently been much lowered within a few years. Addison, in
<cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 98, declares that "within my own memory I have
known it rise and fall about thirty degrees." In the latter half of
the century, about 1775, it again attained proportions even more
startling than in Addison's day.</p>

of forty pounds a year, or two hundred pounds' worth of goods and
chattels, should be allowed to shoot game. The law continued in
force until 1827.</p>

<p><b>144</b>: 23. <b>Petty jury.</b> The twelve men selected to determine
cases, civil or criminal, in court, according to the evidence presented
to them; called petty (or petit) jury to distinguish them
from the <em>grand jury</em>, whose principal function is to decide whether
the evidence against a suspected person is sufficient to warrant
holding him for trial by a petty jury.</p>

<p><b><a id="p145"></a><a href="#Page_145">145</a></b>: 20. <b>Much might be said on both sides.</b> Sir Roger's

<p><b><a id="p146"></a><a href="#Page_146">146</a></b>: 12. <b>A look of much business and great intrepidity.</b>
One of Addison's best bits of description.</p>

<p><b><a id="p147"></a><a href="#Page_147">147</a></b>: 19. <b>The Saracen's Head.</b> In early days, before city
streets were numbered, not only inns but shops usually were
designated by some sign painted or carved at the door. In the
case of inns this practice still survives, and most English inns of
the county towns bear the name of some object that once served as
a sign, as the Angel (Lincoln), the Fountain (Canterbury), the
Bull (Cambridge), the Three Swans (Salisbury). Ever since the
time of the Crusades the head of a Saracen, or Turk, had been a
favourite sign. Readers of Boswell's <cite>Life of Samuel Johnson</cite> will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
recall the Turk's Head Tavern in Gerrard Street, London, where

</h3>
<p><b>Motto.</b> "Learning improves native genius, and right training

<p><b><a id="p149"></a><a href="#Page_149">149</a></b>: 23. <b>A story I have heard.</b> Addison probably invented
this story, and he certainly thought well of it himself. On the
same day this paper was printed he sent to his friend Edward
Wortley Montague a letter beginning thus: "Being very well
pleased with this day's <cite>Spectator</cite>, I cannot forbear sending you one
of them, and desiring your opinion of the story in it. When you
have a son, I shall be glad to be his Leontine, as my circumstances
will probably be like his." The tone of discouragement in the
last clause is explained by Addison's statements, later in the letter,
that he has recently lost large sums of money, "and what is worse
than all the rest, my mistress." The Countess of Warwick was evidently
not smiling upon him just then, and Addison saw himself
in the future&mdash;if not like Leontine, a widower&mdash;a bachelor in
humble circumstances.</p>

<p><b>149</b>: 27. <b>Like a novel.</b> The word <em>novel</em> was introduced into
English in the sixteenth century as a name for the Italian <em>novelle</em>,
or short tales, translations of which were then very numerous in
England. In Addison's time it was still used to designate a short
story as distinguished from the longer romances like those in the
<em>Ladies Library</em> (V of this volume). The modern novel, an extended
narrative of real life, with careful plot usually having for
its central motion the passion of love, was not yet written in English.
It is usually said to begin with the work of Richardson and
Fielding, 1740-1750.</p>

to October, 1710, when the Whigs went out of power.</p>

<p><b>150</b>: 23. <b>According to Mr. Cowley.</b> "You would advise me

to stay a while longer with patience and complaisance, till I had
gotten such an estate as might afford me (according to the saying
of that person whom you and I love very much and would believe
as soon as another man) 'cum dignitate otium.' That were excellent
advice to Joshua, who could bid the sun stay too. But there is
no fooling with life when it is once turned beyond forty. The seeking
for a fortune then is but a desperate after-game."&mdash;Cowley's
Essay, <cite>The Danger of Procrastination</cite>. Also see note, p. 234.</p>

</h3>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p><b><a id="p155"></a><a href="#Page_155">155</a></b>: 1. <b>The malice of parties.</b> Party feeling had perhaps
never been more bitter in England than just at this time; and it
was probably all the more bitter and personal because there were
no very clear questions at issue between the two parties. Swift,
writing in the Tory <cite>Examiner</cite> a few months before the date of this
paper (November 16, 1710), says, "Let any one examine a reasonable
honest man, of either side, upon those opinions in religion and
government, which both parties daily buffet each other about, he
shall hardly find one material point in difference between them."
The principal questions upon which Whig and Tory had once
actively differed, and still continued to differ in theory, were two.
The first was the nature of the monarchy and its relation to the other
parts of the government. The extreme Tories held that the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
had a divine right to his throne, by hereditary succession; that this
was indefeasible, and implied the duty of unconditional obedience
from the subject. The extreme Whigs held that the king was the
creation of the people, and held his office purely by act of Parliament.
But it would have been difficult to find many such extreme
Tories or extreme Whigs. The doctrine of the divine right of kings
had been practically refuted by the Revolution of 1688; if there
were any such right, then the crown belonged, not to Anne, but to
the Pretender, son of James II. On the other hand, few Whigs would
have denied that the monarchy was an essential part of the English
system of government, and not the mere creature of parliament.</p>

<p>The other and more important subject of difference between the
two parties was the relation of the Church to the State and to Dissent.
The Tories were Churchmen, and held that the interests of
the Church and of religion demanded more constant and detailed
attention from the State, and more stringent measures to repress
dissent. They always called themselves the Church party; Queen
Anne never called them anything else. The Whigs, on the other
hand, though many of them were good Churchmen, apprehended
less danger from dissent and were more liberal toward it. The
Dissenters themselves, of course, were all Whigs.</p>

<p>There was, however, another difference between the two parties
quite as important as any speculative question, and daily growing
more important. As was stated in the Introduction, the most significant
social fact in the England of the first half of the eighteenth
century is the growth of a great middle, commercial class, who were
gaining wealth rapidly and filling up the towns. At the bottom of
much political controversy between 1700 and 1715 was the undefined
jealousy between this class and the landed class. It was
trade against land, new wealth against old aristocracy, town against
country. For this commercial class almost to a man were Whigs;
the landed gentry and their dependants, country squires and country
parsons, almost to a man, were Tories.</p>

<p>This jealousy became extremely bitter about 1710. During all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the reign of Anne, England had been engaged in the great war of
the Spanish succession, the real object of which was to prevent the
virtual union of the crowns of France and Spain. The war was
heartily supported from the first by the Whigs, but opposed, or only
languidly supported, by the Tories. A successful war is always
popular, and strengthens the party that favours it most; accordingly,
through the earlier years of the reign, when the English general
Marlborough was winning his famous victories, the Whigs had
everything their own way, and by 1708 the government was entirely
in their hands. But as the war, however successful, seemed no
nearer ending, and its burdens began to press more heavily, Tory
opposition strengthened, and party feeling grew more and more
intense. The financial load fell mostly on the Tory or landed class;
for, as the Tories said, so soon as ever a trading Whig could get a
thousand pounds, he put it into government securities, which he
had to pay no tax upon, while the land had to pay him a handsome
rate of interest. This opposition to the Whigs, strengthened by a
feeling that the cause of the church and of religion was endangered
by Whig supremacy, grew to such volume that in the memorable
elections of 1710 the Whigs were defeated, and a Tory majority
brought into the Commons. The Whig ministers were dismissed;
Marlborough, the great general, a little later was recalled from the
army; and finally the queen took the unprecedented step of creating
twelve new Tory peers, and so making a Tory majority in the
House of Lords also.</p>

<p>It was in these stormy years that <cite>The Spectator</cite> appeared. In the
tumult of partisan controversy Addison succeeded in keeping his
paper out of the strife. He was a pronounced Whig himself, and
his preferences are plainly enough to be seen even in these papers;
but he sincerely deprecated the rancorous tone of party writing,
and he wisely refused to allow <cite>The Spectator</cite> to become the organ
of a party. Steele had more difficulty in restraining his pen, and
finally retired from <cite>The Spectator</cite> rather than remain quiet on public
questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p><b>155</b>: 4. <b>Roundheads and Cavaliers.</b> The Puritans, during

<p><b>155</b>: 6. <b>St. Anne's Lane.</b> Probably the lane of that name in
Westminster, near the Abbey.</p>

<p><b>155</b>: 12. <b>Prick-eared cur.</b> A dog with pointed ears. The epithet

<p><b>157</b>: 8. <b>Many good men ... alienated from one another.</b> It
is probable Addison had especially in mind his own old friendship
with Swift, which had grown very chill of late on account of their
political differences. As early as December 14, 1710, when he began
to be intimate with the new Tory ministry, Swift writes in the
<cite>Journal to Stella</cite>, "Mr. Addison and I are as different as black and
white, and I believe our friendship will go off by this damned business
of party." A month later, January 14, 1711, he says, "At the
coffee-house talked coldly awhile with Mr. Addison; all our friendship
and dearness are off; we are civil acquaintances, talk words,
of course, of when we shall meet, and that is all."</p>

the Romans to characterize the treachery of the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><b><a id="p183"></a><a href="#Page_183">183</a></b>: 21. <b>Throws down no man's enclosure, and tramples

the grounds of their neighbours or their tenants.</p>

<p><b><a id="p184"></a><a href="#Page_184">184</a></b>: 22. <b>His family had never been sullied by a trade.</b> It

<p><b><a id="p185"></a><a href="#Page_185">185</a></b>: 15. <b>Gray's Inn Walks.</b> The walks and gardens of
Gray's Inn (see note, p. 221) were a favourite resort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p><b>185</b>: 18. <b>Prince Eugene.</b> Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736), a
famous Austrian general. He had fought side by side with Marlborough
through several campaigns in the great War of the Spanish
Succession that was now drawing to a close. At this time
Marlborough had just been dismissed from his command in the
army (see p. 244), and the English Tory ministry were making
negotiations for a peace. Prince Eugene visited London to urge
the continuance of the war and the restoration of Marlborough,
but his mission was futile.</p>

<p><b><a id="p186"></a><a href="#Page_186">186</a></b>: 5. <b>Scanderbeg.</b> Corrupt form of Iskander (Alexander)
Bey; a noted Albanian chief, whose name was George Castriota,
born 1404. He won many victories against the Turks.</p>

<p><b>186</b>: 24. <b>Out of Dr. Barrow.</b> See VI, p. 79. Dr. Isaac Barrow
(1630-1677) was one of the most eloquent divines of his age.</p>

<p><b><a id="p187"></a><a href="#Page_187">187</a></b>: 1. <b>Tobacco stopper.</b> A small plug, made of wood or
bone, to pack the tobacco in the bowl of a pipe.</p>

<p><b><a id="p188"></a><a href="#Page_188">188</a></b>: 14. <b>The late Act of Parliament</b>, the <cite>Act to repress Occasional
Conformity</cite>, passed 1710. By the Test Act of 1673 it was
required of every person filling any civil office that he should take
the sacrament, at certain times, according to the forms of the
Church of England. The object, of course, was to exclude all
Romanists and all Dissenters from office. But it was found that
many Dissenters did not feel themselves forbidden by conscience
to take the sacrament occasionally from the hands of a priest of
the Church of England, if only so they could qualify for office. A
bill to prevent this "Occasional Conformity" was warmly urged
through all the earlier years of the reign of Anne; but so long as the
Whigs were in power, it was impossible to pass it. When the Tories
came in, in 1710, they naturally passed it at once.</p>

<p><b>188</b>: 19. <b>Plum-porridge.</b> Extreme Dissenters looked with
disfavour upon all Christmas festivities as savouring of Romish
observance.</p>

<p><b>188</b>: 28. <b>The Pope's Procession.</b> November 17, the anniversary
of the accession of Queen Elizabeth, was long celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
by parades and processions in which the pope and Catholic
traditions were turned into ridicule. These parades were often
the occasion of popular tumult; but, in 1711, some of the more
violent Whigs planned an especially offensive demonstration,
which had to be suppressed by the authorities. Swift writes on
the evening of the day: "This is Queen Elizabeth's birth-day" [he
was in error there; it was not her birth, but her accession, that was
celebrated], "usually kept in this town by apprentices, etc.; but the
Whigs designed a mighty procession by midnight, and had laid out
a thousand pounds to dress up the pope, devil, cardinals, Sacheverel,
etc., and carry them with torches about, and burn them....
But they were seized last night, by order of the secretary; you will
have an account of it, for they bawl it about the streets already.
They had some very foolish and mischievous designs; and it was
thought they would have put the rabble upon assaulting my lord
treasurer's house, and the secretary's; and other violences. The
militia was raised to prevent it, and now, I suppose, all will be
quiet."&mdash;<cite>Journal to Stella</cite>, November 17, 1711.</p>

<p>Addison naturally rather minimizes the disturbance by the
absurd question of Sir Roger.</p>

<p><b><a id="p189"></a><a href="#Page_189">189</a></b>: 10. <b>Baker's Chronicle.</b> See note, p. 226. The <cite>Chronicle</cite>

</h3>
<p><b>Motto.</b> "Yet we must go whither Numa and Ancus have gone
before."&mdash;Horace, <cite>Epistles</cite>, I. vi. 27.</p>

<p><b><a id="p190"></a><a href="#Page_190">190</a></b>: 2. <b>Paper upon Westminster Abbey</b>, <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 26.
That paper with this one perhaps show Addison, in two different
moods, at his very best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p><b>190</b>: 17. <b>The Widow Trueby's Water.</b> The "strong waters"
of that time, like many of the patent medicines of ours, owed their
vogue largely to the fact that they were made of distilled spirits.
See Addison's account of some of the quack medicines of the day
in <cite>Tatler</cite>, No. 224.</p>

<p><b><a id="p191"></a><a href="#Page_191">191</a></b>: 11. <b>The sickness being at Dantzic.</b> The great plague
there in 1709.</p>

<p><b>191</b>: 14. <b>A hackney-coach.</b> Hackney-coaches, or carriages
for hire in the streets, were introduced into London during the
latter half of the seventeenth century. By Addison's time they had
become common; in 1710, by statute, the number to be licensed in
London was fixed at eight hundred. The fare was a mile and a
half for a shilling. The coachmen were an uncivil and pugnacious
class, which accounts for Sir Roger's preference for an elderly one.
Graphic pictures of the manners of coachmen may be found in Gay's
<cite>Trivia</cite>, ii. 230-240, 311-315; iii. 35-50.</p>

<p><b><a id="p192"></a><a href="#Page_192">192</a></b>: 10. <b>A roll of their best Virginia.</b> Tobacco for smoking
was made into ropes or short rolls, and had to be cut up for the
pipe.</p>

<p><b>192</b>: 16. <b>Sir Cloudesley Shovel.</b> A famous English admiral,
who took a prominent part in the great victory of the combined
Dutch and English fleets over the French, off La Hogue, in May,
1692. He was afterward drowned at sea; but his body was recovered
and buried in the Abbey. The monument to Sir Cloudesley
Shovel Addison, in No. 26, criticizes as in bad taste, and with very
good reason.</p>

<p><b>192</b>: 18. <b>Busby's tomb.</b> Richard Busby (1606-1695), for
fifty-five years headmaster of Westminster school. He used to say
that "the rod was his sieve, and that whoever could not pass through
that was no boy for him." He persistently kept his hat on when
Charles II came to visit his school, saying it would never do for
his boys to imagine there was anybody superior to himself.</p>

<p><b>192</b>: 23. <b>The little chapel on the right hand.</b> St. Edmund's,
in the south aisle of the choir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p><b>192</b>: 26. <b>The lord who had cut off the King of Morocco's
head.</b> An inscription recording this feat&mdash;probably legendary&mdash;formerly
hung over the tomb of Sir Bernard Brocas, who was
beheaded on Tower Hill, 1400.</p>

<p><b><a id="p193"></a><a href="#Page_193">193</a></b>: 1. <b>Cecil upon his knees.</b> William Cecil, Lord Burleigh,
Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth. He is represented "on his
knees" at the magnificent tomb of his wife and daughter. This
tomb, however, is not in the chapel of St. Edmund, but in the adjoining
chapel of St. Nicholas.</p>

<p><b>193</b>: 3. <b>Who died by the prick of a needle.</b> This story was
formerly told of Lady Elizabeth Russell, whose richly decorated
tomb is in St. Edmund's chapel.</p>

<p><b>193</b>: 10. <b>The two coronation chairs.</b> In that chapel of Edward
the Confessor which is the heart of the Abbey. One chair is
said to have been that of Edward the Confessor; in it every sovereign
of England from Edward I to Edward VII has been
crowned. The other was made for Mary when she and her husband
William were jointly crowned king and queen of England.</p>

<p><b>193</b>: 11. <b>The stone ... brought from Scotland.</b> The "stone
of Scone," traditionally reputed to be that on which Jacob rested
his head when he had the vision of the ladder reaching up to
heaven. It was brought from Ireland to Scone in Scotland, and
all Scottish kings were crowned on it there till Edward I of England
brought it to London in 1296, and ordered it enclosed "in a chair of
wood," and placed in the Abbey.</p>

<p><b>193</b>: 25. <b>Edward the Third's sword.</b> "The monumental
sword that conquered France," as Dryden calls it, stands between
the coronation chairs.</p>

<p><b><a id="p194"></a><a href="#Page_194">194</a></b>: 2. <b>The Black Prince.</b> Edward, Prince of Wales, eldest
son of Edward III, who died in 1376 before his father. He is
buried, not in the Abbey, but in the cathedral at Canterbury.</p>

<p><b>194</b>: 8. <b>Touched for the evil.</b> Scrofula, called "king's evil,"
because it was supposed that it could be cured by the touch of a
legitimate sovereign. King William III, as he was king only by act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
of Parliament, had not "touched"; but Queen Anne, unquestionably
a legitimate monarch, resumed the practice. Samuel Johnson
was touched by her in his infancy, but without effect. No sovereign
after Anne pretended to this power. The act of "touching"
was accompanied by an elaborate ceremony, the ritual for which
continued to be included in the Book of Common Prayer until
1719. For an account of the procedure, see Ashton, <cite>Social Life in
the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, Chap. xxx, pp. 325-326.</p>

<p><b>194</b>: 12. <b>One of our English kings without an head.</b>
Henry V. The head of the effigy, which was of solid silver, was
stolen in the reign of Henry VIII, at the time of the dissolution
of the monasteries.</p>

<p><b><a id="p195"></a><a href="#Page_195">195</a></b>: 4. <b>His lodgings in Norfolk Buildings.</b> In II Sir
Roger is said, when in town, to "live in Soho Square," a more
aristocratic quarter. That paper was written by Steele; this by
Addison.</p>


<h3>XXIX. <span class="smcap">Sir Roger at the Play</span>
</h3>
<p><b>Motto.</b> "I bid the skilful poet find his models in actual life; then
his words will have life."&mdash;Horace, <cite>Ars Poetica</cite>, v. 327.</p>

<p><b>195</b>: 11. <b>The Committee.</b> A play by Sir Robert Howard,
brother-in-law of Dryden. It was a satire on the Puritans, which
explains its reputation as "a good Church of England play."</p>

<p><b>195</b>: 14. <b>This distressed mother.</b> The "new tragedy" Sir
Roger went to see was an adaptation by Addison's friend, Ambrose
Phillips, of Racine's <cite>Andromaque</cite>, and bore the title <cite>The Distressed
Mother</cite>.</p>

<p><b><a id="p196"></a><a href="#Page_196">196</a></b>: 1. <b>The Mohocks.</b> A company of young swaggerers who
roamed the streets of London at night, committing various insults
upon belated passers. They were specially bold at just this time.
Swift has several entries in the <cite>Journal to Stella</cite> about them.
March 12: "Here is the devil and all to do with these Mohocks....
My man tells me that one of the lodgers heard in a coffee-house,
publicly, that one design of the Mohocks was upon me if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
could catch me; and though I believe nothing of it, I forbear
walking late." March 16. "Lord Winchelsea told me to-day at
court that two of the Mohocks caught a maid of old Lady Winchelsea's,
at the door of their house in the park, with a candle and had
just lighted out somebody. They cut all her face and beat her
without provocation." March 18. "There is a proclamation out
against the Mohocks. One of those that was taken is a baronet."
March 26. "Our Mohocks go on still, and cut people's faces every
night, but they shan't cut mine. I like it better as it is." Further
facts about them may be found in <cite>Spectators</cite>, Nos. 324, 332, 347.
For a full account, see Ashton's <cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen
Anne</cite>, Chap. xxxvi.</p>

<p><b>196</b>:23. <b>That we may be at the house before it is full.</b>
The play usually began at five o'clock.</p>

<p><b><a id="p197"></a><a href="#Page_197">197</a></b>:1. <b>Battle of Steenkirk</b>, August 3, 1692, in which the
English were defeated by the French. The battle gave name to a
kind of loose cravat or neckcloth for men, introduced from Paris,
which was fashionable for years, called a "steenkirk" or "steinkirk,"
because its careless style suggested the eagerness with which
the victorious French gentlemen rushed into battle half dressed.</p>

<p><b>197</b>:18. <b>Pyrrhus</b>, the son of Achilles. In the play, Andromache,
the "widow" of Hector, and "the distressed mother"
of young Astyanax, after the fall of Troy is the captive of Pyrrhus.
Pyrrhus wooes her, promising that if she become his wife, her son
Astyanax shall be made king of Troy. She at last consents,
secretly resolving to kill herself before the marriage can be consummated.
But Hermione, betrothed to Pyrrhus, maddened with
jealousy, incites the Greeks to rebellion against Pyrrhus, with the
result that just as Astyanax has been proclaimed king, Pyrrhus is
slain by Orestes, Hermione takes her own life, and Orestes goes
mad.</p>

<p><b><a id="p198"></a><a href="#Page_198">198</a></b>:4. "<b>You can't imagine, sir, what 'tis to have to do
with a widow!</b>" But Addison, just about this time, <em>did</em> know
how that was himself. See Introduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p><b>198</b>: 13. <b>Your dramatic rules.</b> Perhaps the knight has in
mind the dramatic "unities" of time, place, and subject; but his
next sentence shows that he has no very definite rules in mind.
He only knows that Mr. Spectator has been writing some learned
papers of late on the drama and poetry; and he cannot see why a
play so simple as this admits any laboured criticism.</p>

<p><b>198</b>: 21. <b>Are now to see Hector's ghost.</b> Because at the
beginning of the fourth act Andromache proposes to visit the tomb
of Hector.</p>

<p><b><a id="p199"></a><a href="#Page_199">199</a></b>: 15. <b>The old fellow in whiskers.</b> Perhaps Phenix, a
friend of Pyrrhus.</p>

</h3>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="ineg"><b>Motto.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Their gardens are maintained by vice."</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="i0">&mdash;Juvenal, <cite>Satires</cite>, i. 75.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b><a id="p205"></a><a href="#Page_205">205</a></b>: 9. <b>Spring Garden.</b> A famous garden and pleasure resort
(more commonly called Fox Hall or Vauxhall Gardens), on the
south side of the Thames, near where the Vauxhall bridge now
spans the river. There was a large garden covering about eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
acres, with arbours, walks shaded by day and lighted at night by
lamps festooned from the trees, a miniature lake, booths for the
sale of refreshments, and a large central "rotunda" for music.
First opened in 1661, Vauxhall was a favourite place of resort all
through the eighteenth century; all the lighter literature of that
century contains frequent references to it. The Gardens were not
finally closed until 1859. For fuller account, see Besant's <cite>London
in the Eighteenth Century</cite>, Chap. iv.</p>

<p><b>205</b>: 19. <b>Temple Stairs.</b> A boat-landing near the Temple
gardens. The most pleasant way of getting from the east of
London to the west, in Addison's time, was by boat on the river.</p>

<p><b><a id="p206"></a><a href="#Page_206">206</a></b>: 16. <b>La Hogue.</b> See note on Sir Cloudesley Shovel, p. 251.</p>

<p><b>206</b>: 29. <b>How thick the city was set with churches.</b> The
"city" is that part of London originally enclosed by a wall, and
extends from the Tower on the east to Temple Bar on the west.
Temple Bar was the gateway over that great thoroughfare which
is called Fleet Street on the east side of it, and the Strand on the
west side. The Bar was demolished in 1878, and its site is marked
by a rather ugly monument surmounted by the arms of the city of
London.</p>

<p><b><a id="p207"></a><a href="#Page_207">207</a></b>: 4. <b>The fifty new churches.</b> The Tories had been brought
into power in 1710 very largely by the popular cry, "The Church
is in danger." (See note, p. 249.) Accordingly, one of the first
acts of the House of Commons, in 1711, was to vote the building of
fifty new churches in London.</p>

<p><b><a id="p208"></a><a href="#Page_208">208</a></b>: 4. <b>Mahometan paradise</b>, because the chief attraction of
the Mahometan heaven is the houris, "the black-eyed," whose
beauty never grows old.</p>

<p><b>208</b>: 28. <b>Member of the quorum.</b> A justice of the peace.</p>


<h3>XXXII. <span class="smcap">The Death of Sir Roger</span>
</h3>
<p>The first number of <cite>The Bee</cite>, a weekly paper set up in 1733, by
Addison's friend, Budgell, contains the following statement: "Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Addison was so fond of this character [Sir Roger de Coverley]
that a little while before he laid down <cite>The Spectator</cite> (foreseeing
that some nimble gentleman would catch up his pen the moment he
quitted it), he said to an intimate friend, with a certain warmth in
his expression which he was not often guilty of, 'By G&mdash;&mdash;, I'll kill
Sir Roger, that nobody else may murder him.' Accordingly the
whole <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 517, consists of nothing else but an account
of the old knight's death, and some moving circumstances which
attended it."</p>

<p>It seems probable that about this time both Steele and Addison
were thinking of bringing <cite>The Spectator</cite> to a close, and this was
the first of a series of papers which should dismiss all the members
of the Spectator Club. In No. 544&mdash;the last of this volume&mdash;Captain
Sentry succeeds to Sir Roger's estate, and passes from
notice; in No. 549 the old clergyman is reported dead, and Sir
Andrew Freeport gives up his business and retires into the country
to make ready for the end; in No. 555 the Spectator makes his
parting bow, and the volume closes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="ineg"><b>Motto.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas for piety and ancient faith."</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span class="i0">&mdash;Virgil, <cite>Ãneid</cite>, vi. 878.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b><a id="p211"></a><a href="#Page_211">211</a></b>: 16. <b>The quorum.</b> The justices of the peace for the
county.</p>

<p><b><a id="p212"></a><a href="#Page_212">212</a></b>: 9. <b>The Act of Uniformity</b>, passed in 1662, provided that
all ministers should declare their unfeigned assent to everything in
the Book of Common Prayer, and should use it at morning and
evening service. The Act threw more than two thousand ministers
out of their livings, and united all Dissenters against the Church.
Of course Tories, like Sir Roger, held it to be a wise and necessary
measure, of utmost importance to the security and stability of the
Church.</p>

<p><b>212</b>: 17. <b>Rings and mourning.</b> It was customary to give by
will mourning rings and mourning gloves and hat bands to a large
number of friends. They would be worn, of course, by such of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
friends as attended the funeral services; but not afterward. See
Ashton's <cite>Social Life in the Reign of Queen Anne</cite>, Chap. iv.</p>


<h3>XXXIII. <span class="smcap">Captain Sentry as Master of Coverley Hall</span>
</h3>
<p><b>Motto.</b> "No one ever had a scheme of life so well arranged but that
circumstances, or age, or experience, would bring him something new,
and teach him something more: so that you find yourself ignorant of
the things you thought you knew, and on experience you are ready to
give up what you supposed of the first importance."&mdash;Terence, <cite>Adelphi</cite>,
v. 4.</p>

<p><b><a id="p216"></a><a href="#Page_216">216</a></b>: 11. <b>Colonel Camperfelt.</b> Colonel Kemperfeldt, the
father of the admiral who was lost in the <em>Royal George</em>, has
often been supposed to be the model from which the character of
Captain Sentry was drawn.</p>

<p class="center"><big>TEACHERS' OUTLINES<br />
FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH</big></p>

<p class="center"><small>Based on the Requirements for Admission to College</small></p>



<p class="center">By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in
English in the Morris High School, New York City.</p>

<p class="center">$0.50</p>
<hr class="full" />
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> little book is intended to present to teachers
plans for the study of the English texts required for
admission to college. These Outlines are full of
inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been
obliged to compare notes with other teachers, visit classes,
and note methods. The volume aims not at a discussion of
the principles of teaching, but at an application of certain
principles to the teaching of some of the books most
generally read in schools.</p>

<p>Â¶ The references by page and line to the book under
discussion are to the texts of the Gateway Series; but the
Outlines can be used with any series of English classics.</p>

<p>Â¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the
general teaching of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric
poetry, the drama, and the essay. The suggestions are
those of a practical teacher, and follow a definite scheme
in each work to be studied. There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.

<p class="center"><big>A HISTORY OF ENGLISH<br />
LITERATURE</big></p>

<p class="center">By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A. (Yale),
Louisville Male High School. Price, $1.25</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">HALLECK'S</span> HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE
traces the development of that literature
from the earliest times to the present in a
concise, interesting, and stimulating manner. Although the
subject is presented so clearly that it can be readily comprehended
by high school pupils, the treatment is sufficiently
philosophic and suggestive for any student beginning the
study.</p>

<p>Â¶ The book is a history of literature, and not a mere collection
of biographical sketches. Only enough of the facts
of an author's life are given to make students interested in
him as a personality, and to show how his environment
affected his work. Each author's productions, their relations
to the age, and the reasons why they hold a position
in literature, receive adequate treatment.</p>

<p>Â¶ One of the most striking features of the work consists in
the way in which literary movements are clearly outlined at
the beginning of each chapter. Special attention is given to
the essential qualities which differentiate one period from
another, and to the animating spirit of each age. The author
shows that each period has contributed something definite
to the literature of England.</p>

<p>Â¶ At the end of each chapter a carefully prepared list of
books is given to direct the student in studying the original
works of the authors treated. He is told not only what to
read, but also where to find it at the least cost. The book
contains a special literary map of England in colors.</p>

AMERICAN LITERATURE</big></p>

<p class="center">By BRANDER MATTHEWS, A.M., LL.B., Professor
of Literature, Columbia University. Price, $1.00</p>
<hr class="full" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">PRESIDENT</span> ROOSEVELT, in an extended and
appreciative review in <cite>The Bookman</cite>, says: "The
book is a piece of work as good of its kind as any
American scholar has ever had in his hands. It is just
the kind of book that should be given to a beginner, because
it will give him a clear idea of what to read, and of
the relative importance of the authors he is to read; yet it
is much more than merely a book for beginners. Any
student of the subject who wishes to do good work hereafter
must not only read Mr. Matthews' book, but must
largely adopt Mr. Matthews' way of looking at things,
for these simply written, unpretentious chapters are worth
many times as much as the ponderous tomes which contain
what usually passes for criticism; and the principles
upon which Mr. Matthews insists with such quiet force
and good taste are those which must be adopted, not
only by every student of American writings, but by every
American writer, if he is going to do what is really worth
doing.... In short, Mr. Matthews has produced
an admirable book, both in manner and matter, and has
made a distinct addition to the very literature of which he
writes."</p>

<p>Â¶ The book is amply provided with pedagogical features.
Each chapter includes questions for review, bibliographical
notes, facsimiles of manuscripts, and portraits, while
at the end of the volume is a brief chronology of American
literature.</p>

<p class="center"><big>NEW ROLFE SHAKESPEARE</big></p>

<p class="center">Edited by WILLIAM J. ROLFE, Litt. D.</p>

<p class="center">40 volumes, each, $0.56</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> popularity of Rolfe's Shakespeare has been extraordinary.
Since its first publication in 1870-83
it has been used more widely, both in schools and
colleges, and by the general reading public, than any similar
edition ever issued. It is to-day the standard annotated
edition of Shakespeare for educational purposes.</p>

<p>Â¶ As teacher and lecturer Dr. Rolfe has been constantly in
touch with the recent notable advances made in Shakespearian
investigation and criticism; and this revised edition he
has carefully adjusted to present conditions.</p>

<p>Â¶ The introductions and appendices have been entirely rewritten,
and now contain the history of the plays and poems;
an account of the sources of the plots, with copious extracts
from the chronicles and novels from which the poet drew
his material; and general comments by the editor, with
selections from the best English and foreign criticism.</p>

<p>Â¶ The notes are very full, and include all the historical,
critical, and illustrative material needed by the teacher, as
well as by the student, and general reader. Special features
in the notes are the extent to which Shakespeare is
made to explain himself by parallel passages from his works;
the frequent Bible illustrations; the full explanations of allusions
to the manners and customs of the period; and descriptions
of the localities connected with the poet's life and works.</p>

<p>Â¶ New notes have also been substituted for those referring
to other volumes of the edition, so that each volume is now
absolutely complete in itself. The form of the books has
been modified, the page being made smaller to adjust them
to pocket use.</p>

<p class="center">(Steps in English Series)</p>

<p>By THOMAS C. BLAISDELL, Ph.D., recently Professor
of English in the Normal High School, Pittsburg, Pa.</p>

<p class="center">$1.00</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> book, which aims to teach young people to
write effectively, is suited for use in any secondary
school. Its ingenious method of treatment, its
fresh and interesting character, its great simplicity and
suggestiveness, will prove stimulating and inspiring to
every student. The work lays a foundation for the
appreciation of literature.</p>

<p>Â¶ Models from the master writers are furnished and pupils
are asked to use their own experiences as working material.
They are taught to write accurately by being trained to
recognize, and thus to avoid, their errors. Principles are
studied only when they are encountered, each pupil being
obliged to learn merely those of which he is ignorant.</p>

<p>Â¶ The most important qualities which characterize literature
are each taken up in turn and considered. Selections
from the works of famous writers are inserted at frequent
intervals for purposes of illustration, and it is shown by
analysis how they appeal to the feelings, and why they
attain the various results necessary to an interesting
expression of their thoughts.</p>

<p>Â¶ When their methods have been discovered and sufficiently
illustrated, the learner is asked to use them in
writing about familiar experiences. At first compositions
of only a few paragraphs in length are required, but later
the character sketch, the short story, and the essay are
taken up. Letter-writing is emphasized throughout the book.</p>

<p class="center"><big>A PUNCTUATION PRIMER</big></p>

<p class="center">By FRANCES M. PERRY, Associate Professor of
Rhetoric and Composition, Wellesley College.</p>

<p class="center">$0.30</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Punctuation Primer is a manual of first principles
or essentials simply and systematically presented; it
is not an elaborate treatise on punctuation. It offers
a few fundamental principles that are flexible and comprehensive,
and easily understood and remembered. The
meaning of the text to be punctuated and the grammatical
structure of the sentence are made the bases for generalization
and division.</p>

<p>Â¶ The discussion is taken up under two main divisions:
The terminal punctuation of sentences, and the punctuation
of elements within sentences. Under punctuation of
elements within sentences, the punctuation of principal
elements, of dependent elements, of coordinate elements,
of independent elements, and of implied elements are
considered in the order given.</p>

<p>Â¶ In addition, several important related topics are treated,
such as paragraphing, quotations, capitalization, compound
words, word divisions, the uses of the apostrophe, the
preparation and the correction of manuscript, conventional
forms for letters, the use of authorities in writing themes,
the correction of themes, and the making of bibliographies.</p>

<p>Â¶ Throughout the carefully selected examples make clear
the meaning of the text, while the exercises provided at
each stage of the work afford the student practice in the
correct application of the principles.</p>

<p>Â¶ Though written primarily to meet the needs of college
freshmen, the primer is an excellent manual for high schools.</p>

<p class="center">INTRODUCTORY COURSE
IN ARGUMENTATION</p>

<p class="center">By FRANCES M. PERRY, Instructor in English in
Wellesley College. Price, $1.00</p>
<hr class="full" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">AN</span> INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN ARGUMENTATION
is intended for those who have not
previously studied the subject, but while it makes a
firm foundation for students who may wish to continue it,
the volume is complete in itself. It is adapted for use in
the first years of college or in the upper classes of secondary
schools.</p>

<p>Â¶ The subject has been simplified as much as has been possible
without lessening its educative value, yet no difficulties
have been slighted. The beginner is set to work to
exercise his reasoning power on familiar material and without
the added difficulty of research. Persuasion has not been
considered until conviction is fully understood. The two
methods in use in teaching argumentation&mdash;the brief-drawing
method and the syllogistic method&mdash;have been combined,
so that the one will help the student to grasp the other.</p>

<p>Â¶ The volume is planned and proportioned with the expectation
that it will be closely followed as a text-book
rather than used to supplement an independent method of
presentation. To that end each successive step is given explicit
exposition and full illustration, and carefully graded
exercises are provided to test the student's understanding
of an idea, and fix it in his memory.</p>

<p>Â¶ The course is presented in three divisions; the first relating
to finding and formulating the proposition for argument,
the second to proving the proposition, and the last,
to finding the material to prove the proposition&mdash;research.</p>

<p class="center">INTRODUCTORY COURSE
IN EXPOSITION</p>

<p class="center">By FRANCES M. PERRY, Associate Professor of
Rhetoric and Composition, Wellesley College.</p>

<p class="center">$1.00</p>
<hr class="full" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Exposition</span> is generally admitted to be the most
commonly used form of discourse, and its successful
practice develops keen observation, deliberation,
sound critical judgment, and clear and concise expression.
Unfortunately, however, expository courses often fail to
justify the prevailing estimate of the value of exposition,
because the subject has been presented in an unsystematized
manner without variety or movement.</p>

<p>Â¶ The aim of this book is to provide a systematized
course in the theory and practice of expository writing.
The student will acquire from its study a clear understanding
of exposition&mdash;its nature; its two processes,
definition and analysis; its three functions, impersonal
presentation or transcript, interpretation, and interpretative
presentation; and the special application of exposition in
literary criticism. He will also gain, through the practice
required by the course, facility in writing in a clear and
attractive way the various types of exposition. The
volume includes an interesting section on literary criticism.</p>

<p>Â¶ The method used is direct exposition, amply reinforced
by examples and exercises. The illustrative matter is
taken from many and varied sources, but much of it is
necessarily modern. The book meets the needs of
students in the final years of secondary schools, or the
first years of college.</p>

<p class="center">By HARRY LYMAN KOOPMAN, A.M., Librarian
of Brown University. Price, 90 cents</p>
<hr class="full" />

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> this book Mr. Koopman, whose experience and
reputation as a librarian give him unusual qualifications
as an adviser, presents to the student at the outset the
advantages of reading, and the great field of literature
open to the reader's choice. He takes counsel with the
student as to his purpose, capacities, and opportunities in
reading, and aims to assist him in following such methods
and in turning to such classes of books as will further the
attainment of his object.</p>

<p>Â¶ Pains are taken to provide the young student from the
beginning with a knowledge, often lacking in older readers,
of the simplest literary tools&mdash;reference books and catalogues.
An entire chapter is given to the discussion of
the nature and value of that form of printed matter which
forms the chief reading of the modern world&mdash;periodical
literature. Methods of note-taking and of mnemonics
are fully described; and a highly suggestive and valuable
chapter is devoted to language study.</p>

<p>Â¶ One of the most valuable chapters in the volume to
most readers is that concerning courses of reading. In
accordance with the author's new plan for the guidance
of readers, a classified list of about fifteen hundred books
is given, comprising the most valuable works in reference
books, periodicals, philosophy, religion, mythology and
folk-lore, biography, history, travels, sociology, natural
sciences, art, poetry, fiction, Greek, Latin, and modern
literatures. The latest and best editions are specified, and
the relative value of the several works mentioned is indicated
in notes.</p>

<p class="center">By FRANK MOORE COLBY, M. A., recently Professor
of Economics, New York University</p>

<p class="center">$1.50</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> volume provides at once a general foundation
for historical knowledge and a stimulus for further
reading. It gives each period and subject its
proper historical perspective, and provides a narrative
which is clear, connected, and attractive. From first to
last only information that is really useful has been included.</p>

<p>Â¶ The history is intended to be suggestive and not
exhaustive. Although the field covered is as wide as
possible, the limitations of space have obliged the writer to
restrict the scope at some points; this he has done in the
belief that it is preferable to giving a mere catalogue
of events. The chief object of attention in the chapters
on mediaeval and modern history is the European nations,
and in treating them an effort has been made to trace their
development as far as possible in a connected narrative,
indicating the causal relations of events. Special emphasis
is given to the great events of recent times.</p>

<p>Â¶ The book is plentifully supplied with useful pedagogical
features. The narrative follows the topical manner of
treatment, and is not overcrowded with names and dates.
The various historical phases and periods are clearly shown
by a series of striking progressive maps, many of which
are printed in colors. The illustrations are numerous and
finely executed. Each chapter closes with a summary and
synopsis for review, covering all important matters.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">MOREY'S</span> OUTLINES OF GREEK HISTORY,
which is introduced by a brief sketch of the progress
of civilization before the time of the Greeks
among the Oriental peoples, pays greater attention to the
civilization of ancient Greece than to its political history.
The author has endeavored to illustrate by facts the most
important and distinguishing traits of the Grecian character;
to explain why the Greeks failed to develop a
national state system, although successful to a considerable
extent in developing free institutions and an organized
city state; and to show the great advance made by the
Greeks upon the previous culture of the Orient.</p>

<p>Â¶ MOREY'S OUTLINES OF ROMAN HISTORY
gives the history of Rome to the revival of the empire by
Charlemagne. Only those facts and events which illustrate
the real character of the Roman people, which show
the progressive development of Rome as a world power,
and which explain the influence that Rome has exercised
upon modern civilization, have been emphasized. The
genius of the Romans for organization, which gives them
their distinctive place in history, is kept prominently in
mind, and the kingdom, the republic, and the empire are
seen to be but successive stages in the growth of a policy
to bring together and organize the various elements of the
ancient world.</p>
